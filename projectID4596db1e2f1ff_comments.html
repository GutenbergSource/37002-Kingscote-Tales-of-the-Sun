<HTML><BODY><p>This text includes a few phrases in Sanskrit, in Devanagari script (easily recognized from the connecting bar on the top). Just mark these [**Devanagari], and I will transcribe them during PP. Similar for other Indian scripts that may appear.

<p><b>CHANGED 22 AUG 2009: Updated code to match normal instructions (as has been applied by some anyway.) If, during formatting, you still encounter the old style formatting (i.e., the dots before, even though they are below, and the codes [/s] or ["n], you can feel free to let them stand as is, with one exception: [.n] should always be an n with a dot above, and [n.] an n with a dot below. During PP, I will deal with all the other variants.)</b>

<p>Further, you will find a number of uncommon accented letters. Type these as follows:

<table>
<tr><td>a with macron (bar above)		<td>&#x0101; <td><code>[=a]</code>	<td>(also on a, i, and u, and maybe others.)
<tr><td>s with acute accent above		<td>&#x015B; <td><code>['s]</code>	<td>
<tr><td>n with dot above				<td>&#x1E45; <td><code>[.n]</code>	<td>(note that this is a quote, to distinguish it from the next character; please don't confuse these n with dot above is pronounced ng, n with dot below more like an English n, but produced in the back of the mouth.)
<tr><td>n with dot below				<td>&#x1E47; <td><code>[n.]</code>	<td>(also below t, d, r, l, s, and maybe others.)
</table>

<p>Note such words as Brâhma&#x1E47; (<code>Brâhma[n.]</code>), gha&#x1E6D;ikâ (<code>gha[t.]ikâ</code>), etc, and the name of the second author, 
Pa&#x1E47;&#x1E0D;it Na&#x1E6D;êsá Sástrî (<code>Pa[n.][d.]it Na[t.]êsá Sástrî</code>).

<p>The book is not very systematic in applying the diacritics. I will normalize these when it makes sense.
