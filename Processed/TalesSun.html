<p class="first">In offering these few Indian tales to the public, I
cannot refrain from adding a few words at the beginning to express to
<span class="corr" id="xd26e160" title=
"Source: Pandit">Pa&#7751;&#7693;it</span> Nat&ecirc;&#347;a
S&aacute;str&icirc; my gratitude for the great assistance he has given
me in collecting them, assistance without which they would never have
seen the light in the shape of a complete volume. When I began writing
down these tales, my only means of collecting them was through my
native servants, who used to get them from the old women in the
bazaars; but the fables they brought me were as full of corruptions and
foreign adaptions as the miscellaneous ingredients that find their way
into a dish of their own curry and rice, and had it not been for Mr.
S&aacute;str&icirc;&rsquo;s timely aid, my small work would have gone
forth to the world laden with inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Mr. S&aacute;str&icirc; not only corrected the errors of my own
tales, but allowed me to add to them many <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e165" href="#xd26e165" name="xd26e165">vi</a>]</span>that he had
himself collected, and that had already been published, either in small
volumes or in numbers of <i>The Indian Antiquary</i>. For this reason I
have left several notes which Mr. Cowper Temple, Mr. Clowston, and
others had added to the tales that had already been printed, as they
were too valuable to dispense with, and may be of service to students
of folklore. In conclusion, I would crave the indulgence of my readers
with regard to the style in which the tales are written, which has been
left as nearly as possible in the form of a literal translation, in
order to lend the Stories a &ldquo;<i>couleur locale</i>,&rdquo; which
is characteristic of the country they spring from.</p>

<h2 class="main">Introduction.</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has often struck all lovers of Folklore and
National Legends with wonder, that so many countries should have
reproduced in different imagery and language the same tales. Persia,
Arabia, and India give us the same fables as Italy, France, Norway, and
Iceland, except for slight variations principally arising from
difference of custom, distance of time, idiom and nationality.</p>
<p>Able writers have explained this to us by a theory worthy of
consideration, and admirable in its origin, but nevertheless wholly
their own. They would have us believe that a certain group of tales
belonged to a certain nation, and that through emigration and
immigration, through wars and dispersions, these same tales have been
carried backwards and forwards and dragged from country to country
borrowing the language and peculiarities of the lands they passed
through, just as the seed of some rare plant is borne <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e528" href="#xd26e528" name=
"xd26e528">x</a>]</span>on the breeze and bears fruit coarse or more
refined according to the soil in which it at last takes root.</p>
<p>In Germany we have G&ouml;deck, K&ouml;hler, Sichecht, and a host of
others who tell us that these tales are Oriental, and that all fable
originates in the East, others again that they are transmitted to us by
the same channel as the Aryan languages from Aryan tradition. I cannot
see why one nation or one country alone should have the intelligence of
producing fables which as a rule are next to religion in their teaching
and intentions. If proverbs are the wisdom of nations, what are fables
and legends but developed proverbs. What is the meaning of fable? It
means an intent to convey moral instruction in a narrative in which the
characters are represented by birds, beasts, or fishes; and often
plants.</p>
<p>Practically a parable is the same thing, and folklore and
fairy-tales are the attempts of intelligent people to inculcate in
their children or other ignorant people the great truths of religion or
wisdom, by means of word-pictures that would bring these truths within
the easy grasp of undeveloped <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e534"
href="#xd26e534" name="xd26e534">xi</a>]</span>minds, it is the old
repeated tale? The Struggle between Right and Wrong. &ldquo;Faust and
Marguerite.&rdquo; The Wicked Punished, The Virtuous Rewarded.</p>
<p>Disguise them as you will, there are certain tendons which run
through the world from age to age; cords which no human hand has yet
severed&mdash;which no decree of God&rsquo;s has changed&mdash;these
are love and death, hate and vengeance, virtue and vice, right and
wrong, suffering and joy; and as long as there is a world, as long as
children are born, parents will invent fables with which to bring these
facts before their offsprings&rsquo; eyes in an intelligible
manner.</p>
<p>In the fables of the East, and especially of India, there is one
peculiarity, namely, that craft and cunning are more generally rewarded
than virtue, and stupidity condemned. This is the national
characteristic. The tales of Southern India are as varied as any
others, either Eastern or European. Magic and supernatural phenomena
play a great part, but are usually assisted by the powers of the gods.
This is again a national Hindoo characteristic. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e540" href="#xd26e540" name=
"xd26e540">xii</a>]</span>The Hindoo would shrink from any undertaking
that is not under the patronage of the gods; yet here is a very
noticeable feature, namely, that the divinities are treated as entirely
secondary in power, interwoven only into a man&rsquo;s daily affairs as
a sort of backbone or support in time of need, but to be despised and
trampled upon at other times with impunity. This is a natural feature
in a nation which has a deity to represent every vice and sin, and
lends a certain character to the tales of Southern India different to
the folklore of other countries.</p>
<p>Probably further research will lay bare many still hidden treasures
of Hindoo folklore; but this small collection of tales will doubtless
suffice to throw light on Indian tradition, and to bring forward the
natural peculiarities of the Hindoos as well as the assimilation of the
folklore of different nations, an assimilation which I maintain results
from the teaching propensities of each country and not from
appropriation.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Story of the Three Deaf Men.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When any awkward blunder occurs from a person acting
under a mistaken notion, there is a common proverb in Tamil to the
effect that the matter ended like the story of the three deaf
men&mdash;(<i>Muchchevi&#7693;an kadaiy&acirc;y mu&#7693;indadu</i>).
The following is the story told to explain the allusion:&mdash;</p>
<p>In a remote village there lived a husband and wife. Both of them
were quite deaf. They had made this household arrangement, namely, to
cook cabbage with tamarind and soup without tamarind one day, and
cabbage without tamarind and soup with tamarind on the other. Thus on
every alternate day the same dishes were repeated. One day, when taking
his meal, the husband found the tamarind cabbage so very tasty that he
wanted to have it also next day, and gave instructions to that effect.
The deaf wife did not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2"
name="pb2">2</a>]</span>understand the order. According to the
established rule she cooked cabbage without tamarind next day. The
husband, when he sat down to his meal, found his order disregarded and,
being enraged thereat, threw the cabbage against the wall, and went out
in a rage. The wife ate her fill, and prepared tamarind cabbage for her
husband.</p>
<p>The husband went out, and sat down in a place where three roads
crossed, to calm down his anger. At that time a shepherd happened to
pass that way. He had lately lost a good cow and calf of his, and had
been seeking them for some days. When he saw the deaf man sitting by
the way, he took him for a soothsayer, and asked him to find out by his
knowledge of <i>J&ocirc;syam</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e570src"
href="#xd26e570" name="xd26e570src">1</a> where the cow was likely to
be found. The herdsman, too, was very deaf; and the man, without
hearing what he was saying, abused him, and wished to be left
undisturbed. In abusing him the husband stretched out his hand,
pointing to the shepherd&rsquo;s face. This pointing the shepherd
understood to indicate the direction where the lost cow and calf would
be found. Thus thinking the poor shepherd went on in that direction,
promising to present the soothsayer with the calf if he found it there
with the cow. To his joy, and by mere chance, he found them. His
delight knew no bounds. &ldquo;That is a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>capital soothsayer. Surely I
must present him with the calf.&rdquo; So thought he to himself, and
returned with them to the deaf man, and, pointing to the calf,
requested him to accept it.</p>
<p>Now it unfortunately happened that the calf&rsquo;s tail was broken
and crooked. The man thought the herdsman was blaming him unreasonably
for having broken the calf&rsquo;s tail, while he knew nothing about
it, and so, by a waive of his hand, denied the charge. This the
shepherd mistook for a refusal of the calf, and a demand for the cow.
The shepherd said, &ldquo;How very greedy you are! I promised you only
the calf, and not the cow.&rdquo; The husband said, &ldquo;Never; I
know nothing of either your cow or calf. I never broke the calf&rsquo;s
tail. Some other must have done it.&rdquo; Thus they quarrelled,
without understanding each other, for a long time, when a third party
happened to pass by. Understanding the cause of the dispute, and,
desiring to profit by their stupidity, he interfered, and said in a
loud voice, and yet so as not to be heard by the deaf husband,
&ldquo;Well, shepherd, you had better go away with the cow. These
soothsayers are always greedy. Leave the calf with me, and I shall make
him accept it.&rdquo; The shepherd, much pleased to have secured the
cow, walked home, leaving the calf with the third person. When the
shepherd had gone, the passenger said to the deaf man, &ldquo;You see
how very unlawful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>it is for the shepherd to charge you with an offence
which you never committed. It is always the case with shepherds. They
are the biggest fools in the world! But never mind, so long as you have
a friend in me. I shall somehow explain to him your innocence, and
restore the calf to him.&rdquo; The husband, much pleased, ran home to
escape from the consequences of supposed guilt. At the expense of the
stupidity and deafness of both, the third traveller walked home with
the calf.</p>
<p>The husband, on his return, sat down to his dinner, and his wife
served him the tamarind cabbage. He happened to put his finger to the
place where the cabbage without tamarind had previously been served on
the leaf. On applying it to his mouth, he found it so very sweet that
he demanded that dish again. The wife replied to him that she had
already emptied the pan. &ldquo;Then at least bring me the cabbage that
is sticking to the saucepan,&rdquo; said the husband; and the wife did
accordingly.</p>
<p>Here ends the story. The latter portion is also said to be the
explanation of a proverb that is prevalent in
Tamil,&mdash;&ldquo;<i lang="ta-latn">&#346;evuru k&icirc;raiyai
val&#804;ichchu p&ocirc;&#7693;u&#7693;i
&#347;u&#7751;aike&#7789;&#7789;a m&ucirc;l&#803;i</i>,&rdquo; meaning,
&ldquo;O thou feelingless deaf woman, give me at least the cabbage that
is sticking to the saucepan.<span class="corr" id="xd26e586" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> This proverb is applied to stubborn
wives, who will have their own way, and do not obey their husbands
submissively in unrefined society. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5"

<h2 class="main">Why Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s cannot eat in the Dark.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among Hind&ucirc;s, especially among
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s of the Madras Presidency&mdash;and I now see from
personal observation that it is the same in the Bombay Presidency
also&mdash;there is a custom, while taking their meals, of leaving
their food uneaten when it so happens that from any cause the light is
blown out. Of course this could occur only in the night-time. Such
mishaps now-a-days take place only in poor families, sitting down to
supper with a single light. Hence the following story, told as the
origin of this custom, is beginning to be forgotten. It runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>In a certain village there lived a Br&acirc;hma&#7751; who had an
only daughter. She was deeply read in Sa&#7749;sk&#7771;it, and was of
the most charming beauty. He procured a husband for her as deeply read
as herself. The betrothal had already taken place; the
<i>muh&ucirc;rta</i> or auspicious time for her marriage was fixed at
the tenth <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e604src"
href="#xd26e604" name="xd26e604src">1</a> of that night. On that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>very evening the son-in-law went to a tank to
perform his <i>Sandhy&acirc; vandana</i> or evening prayers. It swarmed
with crocodiles. People never went near it. The son-in-law, being quite
new to the village, entered the tank without knowing anything of the
danger. Unfortunately, there was none near to warn him. He had set his
foot in the water when a crocodile caught him by the leg, and began to
drag him into the water. That very night was fixed for his nuptials,
and a crocodile was taking him to feast on his flesh. He was extremely
horrified at his position, and said humbly to his enemy, &ldquo;My
friend crocodile! Listen to my words first, and then decide for
yourself. A wife, the only daughter of an old Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, is
waiting for me to-night. If you eat me now, you take me away without my
seeing her, my father-in-law, and other relatives. Their hearts may
break at the news of my death on the very day of the wedding. They may
all curse you. If, on the contrary, you leave me now, I shall go home,
speak to my wife and others about the sad calamity that has come over
me, and after embracing and taking leave of her will come to you for
your supper at the fifteenth <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</i>. Till then
leave me.&rdquo; The cruel crocodile, though very fond of human flesh,
and himself dying of hunger, spared him for a few
<i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</i> at his humble request. After extracting
several oaths from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>him that he would return in accordance to his
promise, the crocodile went into the water.</p>
<p>The son-in-law also went home. All his joy vanished; how could he be
happy after his promise to the crocodile. Still, to give no uneasiness
to the aged parents of his wife, he underwent all the ceremonies of the
marriage. Only five more <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</i> remained for him
to live in the world, as he thought. He, in a few words, explained
everything to his wife, and asked her permission to leave her. She
showed no sign of sorrow, preached to him about the iron hand of fate,
and that he must undergo what was written on his forehead. She most
willingly gave him permission to go, and he returned to the tank even a
<i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</i> earlier, and called the crocodile, who came
and seized him.</p>
<p>At this moment a certain light glittered before the eyes of the
crocodile and vanished. It was a <span class="corr" id="xd26e631"
title="Source: woman&rsquo;s">woman</span> that did it. The wife, after
consoling her husband, and preaching to him about the supremacy of
fate, had accompanied him unobserved with a lighted lamp concealed in a
vessel. Just when the crocodile applied its teeth to the leg of her
husband, she took the lamp out, flashed it before the crocodile&rsquo;s
eyes, and quenched it. Nor was it without its intended effect. The
crocodile left the husband to himself, and said, &ldquo;You had better
go now; I will never touch you after seeing a lamp <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>extinguished
when I began my meal to-day.&rdquo; The husband was astonished at the
device of his wife, and still more at the faithful observance of a rule
in an unreasonable beast. From that day it was fixed that men, who are
still more reasonable, should never eat when the lamp is blown out.</p>
<p>Another story is told. In a remote village there lived a poor woman,
who laboured from morning till night in different houses, and returned
to her hut with two measures of rice. That quantity would serve for ten
ordinary persons. Being extremely poor, she used to keep no lamp, but
cook her rice in the dark, only guided by the light of the fire. When
she sat down for her meal even the light of the fire faded; so she had
to eat in the dark. Though she used the full two measures of rice that
she brought away every day, her hunger was never satisfied; she was
always in extreme want.</p>
<p>Now it so happened that she had a younger sister, who was somewhat
richer than herself. The younger came to see her elder sister. The
former never used to be without a light, and so asked her sister to buy
some oil that night and light a lamp. The elder was compelled by
necessity to do so; for that, she devoted a portion of her two measures
of rice, and returned home with great uneasiness and perplexity of mind
as to how less than two measures would furnish their supper that night,
while full two measures <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9"
name="pb9">9</a>]</span>were found insufficient on former occasions for
herself alone. The lamp was set for the first time in her house, and
she cooked the remaining rice. The younger sister was astonished to see
her using so much for two. The elder, thinking within herself that the
younger would soon see her mistake, cooked everything. Two leaves were
spread, and they sat down to their supper.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e642src" href="#xd26e642" name="xd26e642src">2</a> Not even a
fourth part of the rice in the pot was consumed, but already they were
satisfied. The younger sister laughed at the foolishness of her elder,
who now said, &ldquo;I do not know what magic you have in you. Every
day I cook two measures of rice, and fast the whole night, without
finding them sufficient for myself. Now a fourth of less than two
measures has satiated both<span class="corr" id="xd26e645" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> Please explain the cause.&rdquo; The younger
sister, who was very intelligent herself, wanted to find out the cause,
and asked next day if she might serve the meals without the lamp.
Instead of eating she stretched out her hand and caught hold of a lock
of hair. She asked the other at once to light the lamp, which, being
done, they found a devil sitting by their side. On being questioned how
he came there, he said that he was in the habit of going to every one
who ate without a lamp, and swallowing his meals fast without leaving
him a morsel. The elder sister <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10"
href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>perceived her mistake, and used
a lamp from that day. The demon ceased to come. She had abundance for
herself and something to spare. So when the lamp is blown out, devils
are said to come and eat out of our leaves. Hence the custom of rising
whenever such mishaps occur. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href=

<p class="first">Thus a Soothsayer when on his death-bed wrote the
horoscope of his second son, and bequeathed it to him as his only
property, leaving the whole of his estate to his eldest son. The second
son pondered over the horoscope, and fell into the following
reflections:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, am I born to this only in the world? The sayings of my
father never failed. I have seen them prove true to the last word while
he was living; and how has he fixed my horoscope! <i lang=
"sa-latn">Janma parabh&#7771;iti d&acirc;ridryam!</i> From my birth
poverty! Nor is that my only fate. <i lang="sa-latn">Da&#347;a
varsh&acirc;&#7751;i bandhanam</i>: for ten years, imprisonment&mdash;a
fate harder than poverty; and what comes next? <i lang=
"sa-latn">Samudrat&icirc;r&ecirc; mara&#7751;am</i>: death on the
sea-shore; which means that I must die away from home, far from friends
and relatives on a sea-coast. The misery has reached its extreme height
here. Now comes the funniest part of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>horoscope, <i lang=
"sa-latn">Ki&ntilde;chit <span class="corr" id="xd26e682" title=
"Source: bh&oacute;gam">bh&ocirc;gam</span> bhavishyati</i>&mdash;that
I am to have some happiness afterwards! What this happiness is, is an
enigma to me: To die first, to be happy for some time after! What
happiness? Is it the happiness of this world? So it must be. For
however clever one may be, he cannot foretell what may take place in
the other world. Therefore it must be the happiness of this world; and
how can that be possible after my death? It is impossible. I think my
father has only meant this as a consoling conclusion to the series of
calamities that he has prophesied. Three portions of his prophecy must
prove true; the fourth and last is a mere comforting statement to bear
patiently the calamities enumerated, and never to prove true. Therefore
let me go to B&acirc;n&acirc;ras, bathe in the holy Ga&#7749;g&acirc;,
wash away my sins, and prepare myself for my end. Let me avoid
sea-coasts, lest death meet me there in accordance with my
father&rsquo;s words. Come imprisonment: I am prepared for it for ten
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus thought he, and after all the funeral obsequies of his father
were over, took leave of his elder brother, and started for
B&acirc;n&acirc;ras.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e688src" href=
"#xd26e688" name="xd26e688src">1</a> He went by the middle of the
Dakha&#7751;,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e691src" href="#xd26e691" name=
"xd26e691src">2</a> avoiding both the coasts, and went on journeying
and journeying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>for weeks and months, till at last he reached the
Vindhya mountains. While passing that desert he had to journey for a
couple of days through a sandy plain, with no signs of life or
vegetation. The little store of provision with which he was provided
for a couple of days, at last was exhausted. The
<i>chombu</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e699src" href="#xd26e699"
name="xd26e699src">3</a> which he carried always full, replenishing it
with the sweet water from the flowing rivulet or plenteous tank, he had
exhausted in the heat of the desert. There was not a morsel in his hand
to eat; nor a drop of water to drink. Turn his eyes wherever he might
he found a vast desert, out of which he saw no means of escape. Still
he thought within himself, &ldquo;Surely my father&rsquo;s prophecy
never proved untrue. I must survive this calamity to find my death on
some sea-coast.&rdquo; So thought he, and this thought gave him
strength of mind to walk fast and try to find a drop of water somewhere
to slake his dry throat. At last he succeeded, or rather thought that
he succeeded. Heaven threw in his way a ruined well. He thought that he
could collect some water if he let down his <i>chombu</i> with the
string that he always carried noosed to the neck of it. Accordingly he
let it down; it went some way and stopped, and the following words came
from the well, &ldquo;Oh, relieve me! I am the king of tigers,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>dying here of hunger. For the last three days I
have had nothing. Fortune has sent you here. If you assist me now you
will find a sure help in me throughout your life. Do not think that I
am a beast of prey. When you have become my deliverer I can never touch
you. Pray, kindly lift me up.&rdquo; Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara, for that
was the name of the Soothsayer&rsquo;s second son, found himself in a
very perplexing position. &ldquo;Shall I take him out or not? If I take
him out he may make me the first morsel of his hungry mouth. No; that
he will not do. For my father&rsquo;s prophecy never came untrue. I
must die on a sea-coast and not by a tiger.&rdquo; Thus thinking, he
asked the tiger king to hold tight to the vessel, which he accordingly
did, and he lifted him up slowly. The tiger reached the top of the well
and felt himself on safe ground. True to his word he did no harm to
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara. On the other hand, he walked round his patron
three times, and standing before him, humbly spoke the following
words:&mdash;&ldquo;My life-giver, my benefactor! I shall never forget
this day, when I regained my life through your kind hands. In return
for this kind assistance I pledge my oath to stand by you in all
calamities. Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me. I am
there with you ready to oblige you by all the means that I can. To tell
you briefly how I came in here:&mdash;Three days ago I was roaming
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>in yonder forest, when I saw a goldsmith passing
through it. I chased him. He, finding it impossible to escape my claws,
jumped into this well, and is living to this moment in the very bottom
of it. I also jumped in, but found myself in the first storey;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e710src" href="#xd26e710" name="xd26e710src">4</a> he
is on the last and fourth storey. In the second storey lives a serpent
half-famished with hunger. In the third storey lies a rat, similarly
half-famished, and when you again begin to draw water these may request
you first to release them. In the same way the goldsmith also may
request. I tell you, as your bosom friend, never assist that wretched
man, though he is your relation as a human being. Goldsmiths are never
to be trusted. You can place more faith in me, a tiger, though I feast
sometimes upon men, in a serpent whose sting makes your blood cold the
very next moment, or in a rat, which does a thousand pieces of mischief
in your house. But never trust a goldsmith. Do not release him; and if
you do, you shall surely repent of it one day or other.&rdquo; Thus
advising, the hungry tiger went away without waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara thought several times of the eloquent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>way in which the tiger addressed him, and admired
his fluency of speech. His thirst was not quenched. So he let down his
vessel again, which was now caught hold of by the serpent, who
addressed him thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh my protector! Lift me up. I am the
king of serpents, and the son of &Acirc;di&#347;&ecirc;sha,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e717src" href="#xd26e717" name="xd26e717src">5</a>
who is now pining away in agony for my disappearance. Release me now. I
shall ever remain your servant, remember your assistance, and help you
throughout life in all possible ways. Oblige me: I am dying.&rdquo;
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara, calling again to mind the
<i>Samudrat&icirc;r&ecirc; mara&#7751;am</i>&mdash;death on the
sea-shore&mdash;lifted him up. He, like the tiger-king, walked round
him thrice, and prostrating himself before him spoke
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, my life-giver, my father, for so I must call
you, as you have given me another birth. I have already told you that I
am &Acirc;di&#347;&ecirc;sha&rsquo;s son, and that I am the king of
serpents. I was three days ago basking myself in the morning sun, when
I saw a rat running before me. I chased him. He fell into this well. I
followed him, but instead of falling on the third storey where he is
now lying, I fell into the second. It was on the same evening that the
goldsmith also fell down into the fourth storey, and the tiger whom you
released just before me fell down into the first. What I have to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>tell you now is&mdash;do not relieve the
goldsmith, though you may release the rat. As a rule, goldsmiths are
never to be trusted. I am going away now to see my father. Whenever you
are in any difficulty just think of me. I will be there by your side to
assist you by all possible means. If, notwithstanding my repeated
advice, you happen to release the goldsmith, you shall suffer for it
severely.&rdquo; So saying, the N&acirc;gar&acirc;ja (serpent-king)
glided away in zigzag movements, and was out of sight in a moment.</p>
<p>The poor son of the Soothsayer who was now almost dying of thirst,
and was even led to think that the messengers of death were near him,
notwithstanding his firm belief in the words of his father let down his
vessel for a third time. The rat caught hold of it, and without
discussing, he lifted up the poor animal at once. But it would not go
away without showing its gratitude&mdash;&ldquo;Oh life of my life! My
benefactor! I am the king of rats. Whenever you are in any calamity
just think of me. I will come to you, and assist you. My keen ears
overheard all that the tiger-king and serpent-king told you about the
Svar&#7751;ataskara<a class="noteref" id="xd26e727src" href="#xd26e727"
name="xd26e727src">6</a> (<i>gold-smith</i>), who is in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>the
fourth storey. It is nothing but a sad truth that goldsmiths ought
never to be trusted. Therefore never assist him as you have done to us
all. And if you do, you shall feel it. I am hungry; let me go for the
present.&rdquo; Thus taking leave of his benefactor, the rat, too, ran
away.</p>
<p>Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara for a while thought upon the repeated advice
given by the three animals about releasing the goldsmith, &ldquo;What
wrong would there be in my assisting him? Why should I not release him
also?&rdquo; So thinking to himself, Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara let down
the vessel again. The goldsmith caught hold of it, and demanded help.
The Soothsayer&rsquo;s son had no time to lose; he was himself dying of
thirst. Therefore he lifted the goldsmith up, who now began his
story:&mdash;&ldquo;Stop for a while,&rdquo; said
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara, and after quenching his thirst by letting down
his vessel for the fifth time, still fearing that some one might remain
in the well and demand his assistance, he listened to the goldsmith,
who began as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;My dear friend, my protector, what a
deal of nonsense these brutes have been talking to you about me; I am
glad you have not followed their advice. I am just now dying of hunger.
Permit me to go away. My name is
M&acirc;&#7751;ikk&acirc;&#347;&acirc;ri. I live in the East main
street of Ujjaini which is twenty <i>k&acirc;s</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e739src" href="#xd26e739" name="xd26e739src">7</a> to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>south of this place, and so lies on your way when
you return from B&acirc;n&acirc;ras. Do not forget to come to me and
receive my kind remembrances of your assistance, on your way back to
your country.&rdquo; So saying the goldsmith took his leave, and
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara also pursued his way north after the above
adventures.</p>
<p>He reached B&acirc;n&acirc;ras, and lived there for more than ten
years, spending his time in bathing, prayers, and other religious
ceremonies. He quite forgot the tiger, serpent, rat, and goldsmith.
After ten years of religious life, thoughts of home and of his brother
rushed into his mind. &ldquo;I have secured enough merit now by my
religious observances. Let me return home.&rdquo; Thus thought
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara within himself, and immediately he was on his
way back to his country. Remembering the prophecy of his father he
returned by the same way by which he went to B&acirc;n&acirc;ras ten
years before. While thus retracing his steps he reached the ruined well
where he had released the three brute kings and the goldsmith. At once
the old recollections rushed into his mind, and he thought of the tiger
to test his fidelity. Only a moment passed, and the tiger-king came
running before him carrying a large crown in his mouth, the glitter of
the diamonds of which for a time outshone even the bright rays of the
sun. He dropped the crown at his life-giver&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>feet,
and putting aside all his pride, humbled himself like a pet cat to the
strokes of his protector, and began in the following
words:&mdash;&ldquo;My life-giver! How is it that you have forgotten
me, your poor servant, for such a long time? I am glad to find that I
still occupy a corner in your mind. I can never forget the day when I
owed my life to your lotus hands. I have several jewels with me of
little value. This crown, being the best of all, I have brought here as
a single ornament of great value, and hence easily portable and useful
to you in your own country.&rdquo; Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara looked at the
crown, examined it over and over, counted and recounted the gems, and
thought within himself that he would become the richest of men by
separating the diamonds and gold, and selling them in his own country.
He took leave of the tiger-king, and after his disappearance thought of
the kings of serpents and rats, who came in their turns with their
presents, and after the usual formalities and exchange of words took
their leave. Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara was extremely delighted at the
faithfulness with which the brute beasts behaved themselves, and went
on his way to the south. While going along he spoke to himself
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;These beasts have been so very faithful in their
assistance. Much more, therefore, must
M&acirc;&#7751;ikk&acirc;&#347;&acirc;ri be faithful. I do not want
anything from him now. If I take this crown with me as it is, it
occupies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>much space in my bundle. It may also excite the
curiosity of some robbers on the way. I will go now to Ujjaini on my
way, M&acirc;&#7751;ikk&acirc;&#347;&acirc;ri requested me to see him
without failure on my return journey. I shall do so, and request him to
have the crown melted, the diamonds and gold separated. He must do that
kindness at least for me. I shall then roll up these diamonds and gold
ball in my rags, and bend my way homewards.&rdquo; Thus thinking and
thinking he reached Ujjaini. At once he enquired for the house of his
goldsmith friend, and found him without difficulty.
M&acirc;&#7751;ikk&acirc;&#347;&acirc;ri was extremely delighted to
find on his threshold him who ten years before, notwithstanding the
advice repeatedly given him by the sage-looking tiger, serpent, and
rat, had relieved him from the pit of death. Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara at
once showed him the crown that he received from the tiger-king, told
him how he got it, and requested his kind assistance to separate the
gold and diamonds. M&acirc;&#7751;ikk&acirc;&#347;&acirc;ri agreed to
do so, and meanwhile asked his friend to rest himself for a while to
have his bath and meals; and Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara, who was very
observant of his religious ceremonies, went direct to the river to
bathe.</p>
<p>How came a crown in the jaws of a tiger? It is not a difficult
question to solve. A king must have furnished the table of the tiger
for a day or two. Had it not been for that, the tiger could not have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>had a crown with him. Even so it was. The king of
Ujjaini had a week before gone with all his hunters on a hunting
expedition. All of a sudden a tiger&mdash;as we know now, the very
tiger-king himself&mdash;started from the wood, seized the king, and
vanished. The hunters returned and informed the prince about the sad
calamity that had befallen his father. They all saw the tiger carrying
away the king. Yet such was their courage that they could not lift
their weapons to bring to the prince the corpse at least of his
father.</p>
<p>When they informed the prince about the death of his father he wept
and wailed, and gave notice that he would give half of his kingdom to
any one who should bring him news about the murderer of his father. The
prince did not at all believe that his father was devoured by the
tiger. His belief was that some hunters, coveting the ornaments on the
king&rsquo;s person, had murdered him. Hence he had issued the notice.
The goldsmith knew full well that it was a tiger that killed the king,
and not any hunter&rsquo;s hands, since he had heard from
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara about how he obtained the crown. Still, ambition
to get half the kingdom prevailed, and he resolved with himself to make
over Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara as the king&rsquo;s murderer. The crown was
lying on the floor where Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara left it with his full
confidence in M&acirc;&#7751;ikk&acirc;&#347;&acirc;ri. Before his
protector&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span>return the goldsmith, hiding the crown under
his garments, flew to the palace. He went before the prince and
informed him that the assassin was caught, and placed the crown before
him. The prince took it into his hands, examined it, and at once gave
half the kingdom to M&acirc;&#7751;ikk&acirc;&#347;&acirc;ri, and then
enquired about the murderer. &ldquo;He is bathing in the river, and is
of such and such appearance,&rdquo; was the reply. At once four armed
soldiers fly to the river, and bound the poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751; hand
and foot, he sitting in meditation the while, without any knowledge of
the fate that hung over him. They brought Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara to the
presence of the prince, who turned his face away from the murderer or
supposed murderer, and asked his soldiers to throw him into the
<i>k&acirc;r&acirc;g&#7771;iham</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e765src"
href="#xd26e765" name="xd26e765src">8</a> In a minute, without knowing
the cause, the poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751; found himself in the dark caves
of the <i>k&acirc;r&acirc;g&#7771;iham</i>.</p>
<p>In old times the <i>k&acirc;r&acirc;g&#7771;iham</i> answered the
purposes of the modern jail. It was a dark cellar underground, built
with strong stone walls, into which any criminal guilty of a capital
offence was ushered to breathe his last there without food and drink.
Such was the cellar into which Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara was thrust. In a
few hours after he left the goldsmith he found himself inside a dark
cell stinking with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24"
name="pb24">24</a>]</span>human bodies, dying and dead. What were his
thoughts when he reached that place? &ldquo;It is the goldsmith that
has brought me to this wretched state; and, as for the prince: Why
should he not enquire as to how I obtained the crown? It is of no use
to accuse either the goldsmith or the prince now. We are all the
children of fate. We must obey her commands.
<i>Da&#347;avarsh&acirc;&#7751;i Bandhanam.</i> This is but the first
day of my father&rsquo;s prophecy<span class="corr" id="xd26e781"
title="Not in source">.</span> So far his statement is true. But how am
I going to pass ten years here? Perhaps without anything to sustain
life I may drag on my existence for a day or two. But how pass ten
years? That cannot be, and I must die. Before death comes let me think
of my faithful brute friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So pondered Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara in the dark cell underground, and
at that moment thought of his three friends. The tiger-king,
serpent-king, and rat-king assembled at once with their armies at a
garden near the <i>k&acirc;r&acirc;g&#7771;iham</i>, and for a while
did not know what to do. A common cause&mdash;how to reach their
protector, who was now in the dark cell underneath&mdash;united them
all. They held their council, and decided to make an underground
passage from the inside of a ruined well to the
<i>k&acirc;r&acirc;g&#7771;iham</i>. The rat <i>r&acirc;j&acirc;</i>
issued an order at once to that effect to his army. They, with their
nimble teeth, bored the ground a long way to the walls of the prison.
After <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>reaching it they found that their teeth could not
work on the hard stones. The bandicoots were then specially ordered for
the business; they, with their hard teeth, made a small slit in the
wall for a rat to pass and repass without difficulty. Thus a passage
was effected.</p>
<p>The rat <i>r&acirc;j&acirc;</i> entered first to condole with his
protector on his misfortune. The king of the tigers sent word through
the snake-king that he sympathised most sincerely with his sorrow, and
that he was ready to render all help for his deliverance. He suggested
a means for his escape also. The serpent <i>r&acirc;j&acirc;</i> went
in, and gave Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara hopes of delivery. The rat-king
undertook to supply his protector with provisions. &ldquo;Whatever
sweetmeats or bread are prepared in any house, one and all of you must
try to bring whatever you can to our benefactor. Whatever clothes you
find hanging in a house, cut down, dip the pieces in water, and bring
the wet bits to our benefactor. He will squeeze them and gather water
for drink! and the bread and sweetmeats shall form his food.&rdquo;
Having issued these orders the king of the rats, took leave of
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara. They, in obedience to their king&rsquo;s order,
continued to supply provisions and water.</p>
<p>The N&acirc;gar&acirc;ja said:&mdash;&ldquo;I sincerely condole with
you in your calamity; the tiger-king also fully sympathises with you,
and wants me to tell you so, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26"
href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>he cannot drag his huge body
here as we have done with our small ones. The king of the rats has
promised to do his best to provide you with food. We would now do what
we can for your release. From this day we shall issue orders to our
armies to oppress all the subjects of this kingdom. The percentage of
death by snake-bite and tigers shall increase from this day. And day by
day it shall continue to increase till your release. After eating what
the rats bring you, you had better take your seat near the entrance of
the <i>k&acirc;r&acirc;g&#7771;iham</i>. Owing to the many sudden
deaths that will occur some people that walk over the prison may say,
&lsquo;How wicked the king has become. Were it not for his wickedness
so many dreadful deaths by snake-bites could never occur.&rsquo;
Whenever you hear people speaking so, you had better bawl out so as to
be heard by them, &lsquo;The wretched prince imprisoned me on the false
charge of having killed his father, while it was a tiger that killed
him. From that day these calamities have broken out in his dominions.
If I were released I would save all by my powers of healing poisonous
wounds and by incantations.&rsquo; Some one may report this to the
king, and if he knows it, you will obtain your liberty.&rdquo; Thus
comforting his protector in trouble, he advised him to pluck up
courage, and took leave of him. From that day tigers and serpents,
acting under the special <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>orders of their kings, united in
killing as many persons and cattle as possible. Every day people were
carried away by tigers or bitten by serpents. This havoc continued.
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara went on roaring as loud he could that he would
save those lives, had he only his liberty. Few heard him. The few that
did took his words for the voice of a ghost. &ldquo;How could he manage
to live without food and drink for so long a time?&rdquo; said the
persons walking over his head to each other. Thus passed months and
years. Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara sat in the dark cellar, without the
sun&rsquo;s light falling upon him, and feasted upon the bread-crumbs
and sweetmeats that the rats so kindly supplied him with. These
circumstances had completely changed his body. He had become a red,
stout, huge, unwieldy lump of flesh. Thus passed full ten years, as
prophesied in the horoscope&mdash;<i>Da&#347;avarsh&acirc;&#7751;i
Bandhanam</i>.</p>
<p>Ten complete years rolled away in close imprisonment. On the last
evening of the tenth year one of the serpents got into the bed-chamber
of the princess and sucked her life. She breathed her last. She was the
only daughter of the king. He had no other issue&mdash;son or daughter.
His only hope was in her; and she was snatched away by a cruel and
untimely death. The king at once sent for all the snake-bite curers. He
promised half his kingdom and his daughter&rsquo;s hand to him who
would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>restore her to life. Now it was that a servant of
the king, who had several times overheard
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara&rsquo;s cries, reported the matter to him. The
king at once ordered the cell to be examined. There was the man sitting
in it. How has he managed to live so long in the cell? Some whispered
that he must be a divine being. Some concluded that he must surely win
the hand of the princess by restoring her to life. Thus they discussed,
and the discussions brought Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara to the king.</p>
<p>The king no sooner saw Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara than he fell on the
ground. He was struck by the majesty and grandeur of his person. His
ten years&rsquo; imprisonment in the deep cell underground had given a
sort of lustre to his body, which was not to be met with in ordinary
persons. His hair had first to be cut before his face could be seen.
The king begged forgiveness for his former fault, and requested him to
revive his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me in a <i>muh&ucirc;rta</i><a class="noteref" id=

of men and cattle, dying and dead, that remain unburnt or unburied
within the range of your dominions; I shall revive them all,&rdquo;
were the only words that Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara spoke. After it he
closed his lips as if in deep meditation, which commanded more respect
than ever. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>Cart-loads of corpses of men and cattle began to come in every
minute. Even graves, it is said, were broken open, and corpses buried a
day or two before were taken out and sent for the revival. As soon as
all were ready, Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara took a vessel full of water and
sprinkled it over them all, thinking only of his N&acirc;gar&acirc;ja
and Vy&acirc;ghrar&acirc;ja.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e833src" href=
"#xd26e833" name="xd26e833src">10</a> All rose up as if from deep
slumber, and went to their respective homes. The princess, too, was
restored to life. The joy of the king knew no bounds. He cursed the day
on which he imprisoned him, blamed himself for having believed the word
of a goldsmith, and offered him the hand of his daughter and the whole
kingdom, instead of half as he promised. Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara would
not accept anything. The king requested him to put a stop for ever to
these calamities. He agreed to do so, and asked the king to assemble
all his subjects in a wood near the town. &ldquo;I shall there call in
all the tigers and serpents and give them a general order.&rdquo; So
said Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara, and the king accordingly gave the order.
In a couple of <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e837" title=
"Source: gha&#7789;ikas">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</span></i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e839src" href="#xd26e839" name="xd26e839src">11</a>
the wood near Ujjaini was full of people, who assembled to witness the
authority of man over such enemies of human beings as tigers and
serpents. &ldquo;He is no man; be sure of that. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>How
could he have managed to live for ten years without food and drink? He
is surely a god.&rdquo; Thus speculated the mob.</p>
<p>When the whole town was assembled, just at the dusk of evening,
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara sat dumb for a moment, and thought upon the
Vy&acirc;ghrar&acirc;ja and N&acirc;gar&acirc;ja, who came running with
all their armies. People began to take to their heels at the sight of
tigers. Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara assured them of safety, and stopped
them.</p>
<p>The grey light of the evening, the pumpkin colour of
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara, the holy ashes scattered lavishly over his
body, the tigers and snakes humbling themselves at his feet, gave him
the true majesty of the god Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e852src" href="#xd26e852" name="xd26e852src">12</a> For who
else by a single word could thus command vast armies of tigers and
serpents, said some among the people. &ldquo;Care not for it; it may be
by magic. That is not a great thing. That he revived cart-loads of
corpses makes him surely Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara,&rdquo; said others.
The scene produced a very great effect upon the minds of the mob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you, my children, thus trouble these poor subjects
of Ujjaini? Reply to me, and henceforth desist from your
ravages.&rdquo; Thus said the Soothsayer&rsquo;s son, and the following
reply came from the king of the tigers; &ldquo;Why should this base
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>king imprison your honour, believing the mere word
of a goldsmith that your honour killed his father? All the hunters told
him that his father was carried away by a tiger. I was the messenger of
death sent to deal the blow on his neck. I did it, and gave the crown
to your honour. The prince makes no enquiry, and at once imprisons your
honour. How can we expect justice from such a stupid king as that?
Unless he adopts a better standard of justice we will go on with our
destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king heard, cursed the day on which he believed in the word of a
goldsmith, beat his head, tore his hair, wept and wailed for his crime,
asked a thousand pardons, and swore to rule in a just way from that
day. The serpent-king and tiger-king also promised to observe their
oath as long as justice prevailed, and took their leave. The goldsmith
fled for his life. He was caught by the soldiers of the king, and was
pardoned by the generous Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara, whose voice now
reigned supreme. All returned to their homes.</p>
<p>The king again pressed Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara to accept the hand of
his daughter. He agreed to do so, not then, but some time afterwards.
He wished to go and see his elder brother first, and then to return and
marry the princess. The king agreed; and Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara left
the city that very day on his way home. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>It so happened that unwittingly he took a wrong road, and had to
pass near a sea coast. His elder brother was also on his way up to
B&acirc;n&acirc;ras by that very same route. They met and recognised
each other, even at a distance. They flew into each other&rsquo;s
arms<span class="corr" id="xd26e867" title="Source: ,">.</span> Both
remained still for a time almost unconscious with joy. The emotion of
pleasure (<i>&acirc;nanda</i>) was so great, especially in
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara, that it proved dangerous to his life. In a
word, he died of joy.</p>
<p>The sorrow of the elder brother could better be imagined than
described. He saw again his lost brother, after having given up, as it
were, all hopes of meeting him. He had not even asked him his
adventures. That he should be snatched away by the cruel hand of death
seemed unbearable to him. He wept and wailed, took the corpse on his
lap, sat under a tree, and wetted it with tears. But there was no hope
of his dead brother coming to life again.</p>
<p>The elder brother was a devout worshipper of
Ga&#7751;apati.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e877src" href="#xd26e877"
name="xd26e877src">13</a> That was a Friday, a day very sacred to that
god. The elder brother took the corpse to the nearest
Ga&#7751;&ecirc;&#347;a<a class="noteref" id="xd26e880src" href=
"#xd26e880" name="xd26e880src">14</a> temple and called upon him. The
god came, and asked him what he wanted. &ldquo;My poor brother is dead
and gone; and this is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"
name="pb33">33</a>]</span>his corpse. Kindly keep it in your charge
till I finish worshipping you. If I leave it anywhere else the devils
may snatch it away when I am absent worshipping you; after finishing
your <i>p&ucirc;j&acirc;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e890src" href=
"#xd26e890" name="xd26e890src">15</a> I shall burn him.&rdquo; Thus
said the elder brother, and, giving the corpse to the god
Ga&#7751;&ecirc;&#347;a, he went to prepare himself for that
deity&rsquo;s ceremonials. Ga&#7751;&ecirc;&#347;a made over the corpse
to his <i>Ga&#7751;as</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e897src" href=
"#xd26e897" name="xd26e897src">16</a> asking them to watch over it
carefully.</p>
<p>So a spoiled child receives a fruit from its father, who, when he
gives it the fruit asks the child to keep it safe. The child thinks
within itself, &ldquo;My father will forgive me if I eat a portion of
it.&rdquo; So saying it eats a portion, and when it finds it so sweet,
it eats the whole, saying, &ldquo;Come what will, what can father do,
after all, if I eat it? Perhaps give me a stroke or two on the back.
Perhaps he may forgive me.&rdquo; In the same way these
<i>Ga&#7751;as</i> of Ga&#7751;apati first ate a portion of the corpse,
and when they found it sweet, for we know it was crammed up with the
sweetmeats of the kind rats, devoured the whole, and began consulting
about the best excuse possible to offer to their master.</p>
<p>The elder brother, after finishing the <i>p&ucirc;j&acirc;</i>,
demanded his brother&rsquo;s corpse of the god. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>god
called his <i>Ga&#7751;as</i> who came to the front blinking, and
fearing the anger of their master. The god was greatly enraged. The
elder brother was very angry. When the corpse was not forthcoming he
cuttingly remarked, &ldquo;Is this, after all, the return for my deep
belief in you? You are unable even to return my brother&rsquo;s
corpse.&rdquo; Ga&#7751;&ecirc;&#347;a was much ashamed at the remark,
and at the uneasiness that he had caused to his worshipper. So he, by
his divine power, gave him a living Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara instead of
the dead corpse. Thus was the second son of the Soothsayer restored to
life.</p>
<p>The brothers had a long talk about each other&rsquo;s adventures.
They both went to Ujjaini, where Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara married the
princess, and succeeded to the throne of that kingdom. He reigned for a
long time, conferring several benefits upon his brother. How is the
horoscope to be interpreted? A special synod of Soothsayers was held. A
thousand emendations were suggested. Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara would not
accept them. At last one Soothsayer cut the knot by stopping at a
different place in reading, &ldquo;<i>Samudra t&icirc;r&ecirc;
mara&#7751;am ki&ntilde;chit</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;On the sea-shore death
for <i>some time</i>.<span class="corr" id="xd26e926" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Then &ldquo;<i>Bh&ocirc;gam
bhavishyati</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;There shall be happiness for the person
concerned.&rdquo; Thus the passage was interpreted. &ldquo;Yes; my
father&rsquo;s words never went wrong,&rdquo; said
Ga&#7749;g&acirc;dhara. The three <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>brute kings continued their
visits often to the Soothsayer&rsquo;s son, the then king of Ujjaini.
Even the faithless goldsmith became a frequent visitor at the palace,
and a receiver of several benefits from royal hands. <span class=

<p class="first">Once upon a time in the town of
Va&ntilde;jaim&acirc;nagar,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e943src" href=
"#xd26e943" name="xd26e943src">1</a> there ruled a king, named
&#346;iv&acirc;ch&acirc;r. He was a most just king, and ruled so well
that no stone thrown up fell down, no crow pecked at the new drawn
milk, the lion and the bull drank water from the same pond, and peace
and prosperity reigned throughout the kingdom. Notwithstanding all
these blessings, care always sat on his face. The fruit which makes
life in this world sweet, the redeemer to him from the horrible
<i>Naraka</i> of <i>Put</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e952src" href=
"#xd26e952" name="xd26e952src">2</a> a Putra,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e963src" href="#xd26e963" name="xd26e963src">3</a> he had not. His
days and nights he spent in praying that God might bless him with a
son. Wherever he saw <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e976" title=
"Source: pipal">p&icirc;pal</span></i> trees
(<i>A&#347;vatthar&acirc;jas</i>),<a class="noteref" id="xd26e982src"
href="#xd26e982" name="xd26e982src">4</a> he ordered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s to surround them. Whatever
medicines the doctors recommended he was ever ready to swallow, however
bitter they might be. &ldquo;Eat even dung to get a son,&rdquo; says
the proverb, and accordingly be did every thing to secure that
happiness, but all in vain.</p>
<p>&#346;iv&acirc;ch&acirc;r had a minister, named Kharavadana, a most
wicked tyrant as ever lived in the world. The thought that the king was
without an heir, and had no hopes of one, awakened in his mind the
ambition of securing for his family the throne of <span class="corr"
id="xd26e990" title=
"Source: Va&#7749;jaim&acirc;nagar">Va&ntilde;jaim&acirc;nagar</span>.
&#346;iv&acirc;ch&acirc;r knew this well. But what could he do. His
only care was to send up additional prayers to frustrate the thoughts
of Kharavadana, and to secure for himself a good position after death,
without undergoing the severe torments of the <i>Put</i>-hell.</p>
<p>At last fortune favoured &#346;iv&acirc;ch&acirc;r; for what
religious man fails to secure his desire? The king in his sixtieth year
had a son. His joy can better be imagined than described. Lacs
(L&acirc;khs) of Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s were fed in honour of the
son-birth festival, <i>Putr&ocirc;tsavam</i>, as it is technically
called. The state prisons were opened, and all the prisoners let loose.
Thousands of kine and innumerable acres of land were offered to
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s, and every kind of charity was duly practised. The
ten days of the <i>S&ucirc;tik&acirc;g&#7771;ihav&acirc;sa</i>
(confinement) were over. On the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38"
href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>eleventh day the father saw his
much longed-for son&rsquo;s face, and read on the lines of it great
prosperity, learning, valour, goodness and every excellent quality.</p>
<p>The cradle-swinging, naming, and other ceremonies were duly
performed, and the prince grew up under the great care generally shown
to a king&rsquo;s son. His name the elders fixed as Sundara.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1008src" href="#xd26e1008" name="xd26e1008src">5</a>
The minister whose only wish was to get the throne for his family, was
much disappointed at the birth of a son to his master. The whole
kingdom rejoiced at the event, and the minister was the only man who
was sorry. When one is disappointed in his high hopes and expectations,
he devises plans to take away the barrier that lies in his way. Even
so, Kharavadana said to himself, &ldquo;Let me see how affairs
progress. The old king is near his grave. When he dies, leaving a son
in his minority I myself must be his regent for a time. Shall I not
then have opportunity enough of securing for ever for myself and my
family the throne of Va&ntilde;jaim&acirc;nagar?&rdquo; So thought he
within himself, and was quiet for a time.</p>
<p>&#346;iv&acirc;ch&acirc;r, who was a very shrewd man, on several
occasions, read the minister&rsquo;s mind, and knew very well how his
intentions stood. &ldquo;This cruel devil <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>may murder my only son. I
care not if he usurps the throne. What I fear is, that he may murder
him. <i>Na daivam &#346;a&#7749;kar&acirc;t param.</i> No other god but
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1018" title=
"Source: &#346;ankara">&#346;a&#7749;kara</span>. And he must have his
own way. If it is so written on the prince&rsquo;s head I cannot avoid
it.&rdquo; Thus sighed &#346;iv&acirc;ch&acirc;r, and this sorrow
(<i>&#347;&ocirc;ka</i>), made him leaner day by day. Just ten years
after the birth of Sundara, the king fell ill and lay on his
deathbed.</p>
<p>&#346;iv&acirc;ch&acirc;r had a servant, named
Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g, whom he had all along observed to be
very honest and faithful. That servant the king called to his side, and
asking all others except Sundara, who was weeping by his father&rsquo;s
pillow, to leave the room, addressed him thus:&mdash;&ldquo;My dear
Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g! I have only a few <i><span class="corr"
id="xd26e1027" title=
"Source: gha&#7789;ikas">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</span></i> before me.
Listen to my words, and act accordingly. There is one God above us all,
who will punish or reward us according to our bad or good acts. If by
avarice or greed of money you ever play false to the trust that I am
going to repose in you that God will surely punish you. It is not
unknown to you what great difficulties I had in getting this only son,
Sundara; how many temples I built, how many Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s I fed,
how many religious austerities I underwent, &amp;c., &amp;c.. God after
all gave me a son.&rdquo; Here his sorrow prevented him from proceeding
further, and he began to cry aloud, and shed tears. &ldquo;Do not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>weep on my account, father. We cannot wipe off
what was written on our heads. We must undergo happiness or misery as
is thereon written by Brahm&acirc;, cried the prince.
Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g was melted at the sight. He took the boy
on his lap, and with his own upper garment wiped his eyes. The old man
continued, &ldquo;Thus you, my faithful Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g,
know everything. I now wish that I had not performed all that I did to
get this son. For when I die at this moment, who is there to take care
of him for the next? Kharavadana may devise plan after plan to remove
my boy from this world, and secure the kingdom for himself. My only
hope is in you. I give him into your hands.&rdquo; Here the aged
father, notwithstanding his illness, rose up a little from his bed,
took hold of his son&rsquo;s hand, and after kissing it for the last
time, placed it in <span class="corr" id="xd26e1032" title=
"Source: Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7751;g&rsquo;s">Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g&rsquo;s</span>.
&ldquo;Care not if he does not get the kingdom. If you only preserve
him from the wicked hands of the minister whom I have all along seen to
be covetous of the throne, you will do a great work for your old
master. I make you from this moment the lord of my palace. From this
minute you are father, mother, brother, servant, and everything to my
son. Take care that you do not betray your trust.&rdquo; Thus ended the
king, and sent at once for the minister. When he came he spoke to him
thus, &ldquo;Kharavadana! See what I am now. Yesterday <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>I was on
the throne. To-day, in a few minutes, I must breathe my last. Such is
the uncertainty of life. Man&rsquo;s good acts alone follow him to the
other world. Take my signet-ring. [Here the king took the ring from off
his finger, and gave it to the minister.] Yours is the throne for the
present, as long as the prince is in his minority. Govern well the
kingdom. When the prince attains his sixteenth year kindly give him
back the throne. Exercise a paternal care over him. Find a good and
intelligent princess for his wife.&rdquo; Suddenly, before his speech
was quite finished, the king felt the last pangs of death. The
sage-looking minister promised him everything.</p>
<p>&#346;iv&acirc;ch&acirc;r breathed his last. After the usual weeping
and wailing of a Hind&ucirc; funeral, his corpse was burnt to ashes in
a sandalwood pyre. All his queens&mdash;and there were several
scores&mdash;committed <i>sat&icirc;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1041src" href="#xd26e1041" name="xd26e1041src">6</a> with the
corpse. The ceremonies were all regularly conducted, the minister
himself superintended everything.</p>
<p>Kharavadana then succeeded to the throne of
Va&ntilde;jaim&acirc;nagar. Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g became the
lord of the palace, and true to his promise exercised all care over his
trust. He was always at the side of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42"
href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>Sundara. That he might not lose
the sweetness of boyhood in study and play,
Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g brought to the palace twenty
gentlemen&rsquo;s sons of good conduct and learning and made them the
prince&rsquo;s fellow-students. A professor for every branch of
learning was employed to teach the prince and his companions. Sundara
thus received a sound and liberal education, only he was never allowed
to go out of the palace. Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g guarded him
very strictly, and he had every reason to do so. For Kharavadana, as
soon as he became king, had issued a notice that the assassin of
Sundara should have a reward of a <i>kar&ocirc;r</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1050src" href="#xd26e1050" name="xd26e1050src">7</a> mohurs;
and already every avaricious hand was in search of his head. Before the
issue of this notice, Kharavadana found out a good girl and married her
to the prince. She lived with her husband in the palace, and
Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g strictly watched her, as she had been
chosen by the minister. He would not allow Sundara to speak to her.
These strict prohibitions displeased the prince, even with his faithful
servant. But the latter could not help it till he had full confidence
in her. He used to advise Sundara not even to take a betel-leaf from
her hands. But love is blind. So the prince within himself accused his
old guardian; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>but he could not help following his orders. Thus
passed on a few years.</p>
<p>Sundara reached his sixteenth year. Nothing happened about the
transference of the kingdom; the prince, almost in imprisonment in the
palace, had forgotten everything about the kingdom.
Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g wished to wait till, as he thought, the
prince had acquired better governing faculties. Thus some time
passed.</p>
<p>Full eight years had elapsed from the death of
&#346;iv&acirc;ch&acirc;r. Sundara was already eighteen, and still he
had not received his kingdom. Nothing was neglected in his education.
Though Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g exercised all paternal care over
him, still it was not to his liking; for he found in him a great
barrier to the pleasures of youth. The only pleasure for the prince,
therefore, was the company of his friends.</p>
<p>One fine evening on the fourteenth day of the dark half of the month
of Vai&#347;&acirc;kha of the <i>Vasanta</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1072src" href="#xd26e1072" name="xd26e1072src">8</a> season, the
prince was sitting with his companions in the seventh story of his
mansion viewing the town. The dusk of evening was just throwing her
mantle over the city. People in their several vocations were at that
time ceasing work, and returning home. In the eastern division of the
town the prince saw a big mansion, and just to break the silence asked
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>friends what that was. &ldquo;That is the
R&acirc;jasth&acirc;nik Kach&ecirc;ri,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1077src" href="#xd26e1077" name="xd26e1077src">9</a> a place you
ought to have been sitting in for the last two years. The wretched
minister, Kharavadana, has already usurped your seat; for, if he had
intended to give you back the kingdom he would have done it two years
ago when you reached your sixteenth year. Let us now console ourselves
that God has spared your life till now, notwithstanding all the awards
promised to the taker of your head. Even the proclamation is dying out
of the memory of the people now.&rdquo; So said one of his friends and
ceased.</p>
<p>These words fell like arrows in the ear of Sundara and troubled him.
Shame that he had been thus treated brought a change of colour over his
face which all his friends perceived, and they felt sorry for having
touched upon the subject. The prince, perceiving that he had played a
woman&rsquo;s part among his friends, resumed or pretended to resume
his former cheerful countenance, and changed the conversation to some
pleasanter topics. They separated very late that night. Before doing
so, Sundara asked them all to present themselves in the
<i>durb&acirc;r</i> hall<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1085src" href=
"#xd26e1085" name="xd26e1085src">10</a> early next morning. At the same
time he also ordered Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g to keep horses
ready for himself and his friends for a morning ride <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>through
the town the next day. &ldquo;I was only waiting to hear such an order
from your own mouth, <i>Mai B&acirc;b Chakravarti</i>!<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1093src" href="#xd26e1093" name=
"xd26e1093src">11</a> I was thinking from your retired disposition that
you were not an energetic man. I will have the horses ready.&rdquo;
Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g at once issued orders to his servants to
keep ready saddled and decked twenty-one horses for the prince and his
companions. He also appointed a certain number of his men to ride in
front of the party.</p>
<p>The morning came. The friends assembled, as promised the previous
evening. The prince and they, after a light breakfast, mounted their
horses. The horsemen rode in front and behind. The prince with his
friends marched in the middle. Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g with
drawn sword rode by his side. The party went through the four main
streets of the town. Every one rose up and paid due respect to their
old king&rsquo;s son. When passing through the street where the
minister&rsquo;s mansion was, Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g perceived
that Kharavadana paid no respect to the royal march. This seemed a most
unbearable insult to Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g. He bit his lips,
gnashed his teeth, and wrung his hands. The prince observed all the
mental pains of his faithful guardian, and laughed to himself at his
simplicity. About mid-day the party returned to the palace. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>friends dispersed, and Sundara after the
ceremonies of the new-moon day had a slight dinner, and retired to
rest.</p>
<p>The morning ride was deep in the mind of the prince. Though he
laughed to himself at the simplicity of Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g
when the latter gnashed his teeth in the morning, the insult had left a
stronger and deeper impression in his heart. The day was almost spent.
Sundara took a very light supper, and shut himself up in his bed-room
before the first watch was quite over. Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g,
as usual, watched outside. The prince found his wife sound asleep in
her bed, and without disturbing her he went up and down the room. A
thread-like substance attracted his attention in a corner of the
bed-chamber. On examination he found it to be a thread ladder. He had
not even time to think how it came into the bed-chamber. Just then
Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g had retired for a few minutes to take
his supper. &ldquo;The old fool is off now to eat; and
Param&ecirc;&#347;vara has thrown this ladder in my way. Let me now
escape.&rdquo; Thus thinking, Sundara came out unobserved by his old
guardian, and ascended to the top of the seventh mansion. From that
place he cast his ladder towards a big tree in the East Main street. On
pulling it he found that it was firmly fixed. &ldquo;Let me get down,
and Param&ecirc;&#347;vara will assist me.&rdquo; So praying, before
the first watch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>was over, the prince got down from his palace, and
was in a few minutes in the East street. The severe watch kept over him
by Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g made it very difficult for him to go
out when he liked, and now by the grace of God, as he thought, he had
escaped that dark new-moon night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is dear to every one. What can I do if any of the
minister&rsquo;s men find me out now and murder me? <i>Na daivam
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1108" title=

"Source: Sa&#7749;kara">&#346;a&#7749;kara</span>, and he will now help
me.&rdquo; Thus thinking he walked to the nearest pyal, and lingered
there till the bustle of the town subsided. Nor was it in vain that he
stopped there. He overheard while there the following conversation take
place between the master and mistress of the house at which he
lingered:&mdash;&ldquo;Console yourself, my wife. What shall we do?
Fate has so willed it on our heads. May Brahm&acirc;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1115src" href="#xd26e1115" name="xd26e1115src">12</a> become
without a temple for the evil that he has sent us. When the old king
was living he appreciated my merits, and at every
<i>Sa&#7749;kr&acirc;nti</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1120src" href=

<i>V&ecirc;das</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1132src" href=
"#xd26e1132" name="xd26e1132src">15</a> Now there reigns a tyrant over
our kingdom. I have been lingering here with the hope that the son of
&#346;iv&acirc;ch&acirc;r would one day come to the throne and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>relieve our sufferings. Now that such hope is
altogether gone, I have made up my mind to leave this nasty city, and
go to some good place where there reigns a king who can appreciate our
<i>y&ocirc;gyat&acirc;</i> (merit).&rdquo; Of these words Sundara
overheard every syllable, and these supplied the fuel to the fire of
shame and anger that was already burning in his mind. &ldquo;Let me try
to win back my kingdom. If I succeed, I shall save other lives. If I
die, I alone die. May Param&ecirc;&#347;vara help me.&rdquo; So saying
he walked out of the town, and passed the east gate. The night was as
dark as could be, for it was a new moon night. Clouds were gathering in
the sky, and there were some symptoms of rain.</p>
<p>There was a Ga&#7751;&ecirc;&#347;a temple on the way. As it was
already drizzling, the prince went inside till the rain should cease.
No sooner had he entered it than he saw two men, who by their
conversation appeared to be shepherds, coming towards that same temple.
They seemed to have been watching their flocks near an adjacent field,
and had come to shelter themselves from the rain in the temple. Sundara
when he saw them, trembled for his life, and crept in. The shepherds
sat down on the verandah, and taking out their bags began to chew
betel-nuts. An idle lizard began to chirp in a corner. To break the
silence, one said to the other, &ldquo;Well, R&acirc;mak&ocirc;n, I
have heard that you are a great soothsayer and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>interpreter of bird sounds and lizard speeches.
Let me know what these chirps of the lizard that we heard just now
mean. Tell me.&rdquo; R&acirc;mak&ocirc;n replied, &ldquo;This is news
which I would never have revealed at any other time. But as no fourth
person is likely to be here at this time on a rainy night, let me tell
you that the prince of the town is now lingering here in this temple.
So the lizard says. Hence I said, &lsquo;no fourth person.&rsquo; I am
glad that no evil hand has yet been tempted, though such a high price
has been set upon his head. The very fact that he has lived up to this
time unhurt in a tiger&rsquo;s domain augurs well for his future
prosperity.&rdquo; R&acirc;mak&ocirc;n had scarcely finished his speech
when the idle lizard again made its chit, chit, and R&acirc;mak&ocirc;n
now asked his friend, Lakshma&#7751;ak&ocirc;n, for that was the
other&rsquo;s name, to interpret those sounds. &ldquo;This has rather a
sad meaning for the prince. The Mantr&icirc;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1146src" href="#xd26e1146" name="xd26e1146src">16</a> and
Pradh&acirc;n&icirc;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1149src" href=
"#xd26e1149" name="xd26e1149src">17</a> are coming here in a few
minutes (<i>nimishas</i>), to consult on a secret topic. So says the
lizard,&rdquo; said Lakshma&#7751;ak&ocirc;n to R&acirc;mak&ocirc;n,
and at that very moment a light was seen at a distance. &ldquo;It is
the minister&rsquo;s carriage. Let us be off. God only must save the
prince.&rdquo; So saying, they both ran away. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p>The feelings of the prince inside were like that of a man who was
being led to the gallows. The bitterest enemy of his life, the minister
himself, was coming to that very place where he was hiding. &ldquo;I
foolishly accused my old guardian, Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g, and
now I see his good intentions. How I am to be spared from this calamity
&#346;a&#7749;kara only knows.&rdquo; Thus thinking, he hurriedly fled
to the inmost part of the temple behind the very image, and sat down
there, still like a stump, without even breathing freely, lest his
breath might reveal him. He had ample time there to admire the sound
knowledge of the shepherds in interpreting the lizard chirps, their
simplicity, their honesty and truthfulness; for, had they been
otherwise, they might at once have caught hold of the prince and made
him over to the tiger minister. True to the interpretation of the
second shepherd, a carriage stopped in front of the
Ga&#7751;&ecirc;&#347;a temple, and there came out of it the
Mantr&icirc; and the Pradh&acirc;n&icirc;. Excepting themselves and, of
course, the carriage driver and, as we know, the prince behind the
Ga&#7751;&ecirc;&#347;a, there were no others there. Kharavadana and
his subordinate chose that solitary place at the dead of night to hold
secret consultations. The Mantr&icirc; spoke first, and one could
easily perceive from his words that he was in a fit of anger.
&ldquo;Why should the prince be thus allowed to ride free through my
streets? Of the innumerable servants <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>who eat our salt was
there not one to cut down that impertinent head?&rdquo; roared the
minister. The Pradh&acirc;n&icirc; replied, &ldquo;My king, my lord,
excuse me first for the humble words that I am going to speak before
your honour. We have taken up a kingdom to which we have no right. If
the prince had demanded the throne two years ago, we ought rightfully
to have returned it to him. He never asked, and we did not restore it.
He never troubles us with demands, but lives like a poor subject of the
crown in his own quarters. Such being the case, why should we kill him?
Why should we murder the only son of our old and much-respected king
&#346;iv&acirc;ch&acirc;r? What I beg to suggest to your honour is,
that we should no more trouble ourselves about his poor head.&rdquo;
The Pradh&acirc;n&icirc;, as he discovered that these words were not to
the taste of Kharavadana, stopped at once without proceeding further,
though he had much to say upon that subject. &ldquo;Vile wretch! Dare
you preach morals to your superiors. You shall see the result of this,
before the morning dawns,&rdquo; bawled out the Minister. The
Pradh&acirc;n&icirc; saw that all his excellent advice was like blowing
a horn in a deaf man&rsquo;s ears. He feared for his own life, and so
at once begged a thousand pardons, and promised to bring the head of
the prince within a week. And as Kharavadana wanted only that, he
spared the Pradh&acirc;n&icirc;. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>then talked on different
subjects, and prepared to start.</p>
<p>The prince inside, behind the
Ga&#7751;&ecirc;&#347;avigraha,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1164src"
href="#xd26e1164" name="xd26e1164src">18</a> was now almost stifled to
death. The short breaths that he inhaled and exhaled were themselves
enough to kill him. Add to that the horrible words that fell on his
ears. For all that he continued to hide himself. Kharavadana and the
Pradh&acirc;n&icirc; finished their conversation and got into the
carriage. Sundara called courage to his assistance,
&ldquo;&#346;a&#7749;kara has saved me till now; he may so save me
throughout.&rdquo; So thinking to himself, he boldly came out of the
temple without making the least noise and sat behind the carriage, and,
as it rolled on, thought again within himself: &ldquo;I will follow
these, come what may, and find out what more plans they devise against
my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carriage drove on to the opposite end of the town. It passed the
west gate and entered a big park outside the town. The undaunted prince
followed. In the middle of the park a fine tank was discovered. The
banks looked like day, being lighted up profusely. In the midst of the
tank a small island with a gaudy mansion was seen. Pillars of gold,
sofas of silver and doors of diamonds made it the very
<i>Indral&ocirc;ka</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1171src" href=
"#xd26e1171" name="xd26e1171src">19</a> itself. A broad road with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>avenues of sweet smelling flowering trees
connected the island with the bank. It was at that road that the
carriage stopped. The prince, before that was reached, had got down and
hid himself under the shade of a tree, to see unobserved all that
passed in the mansion which he had every reason to believe was the
destination of the minister. Kharavadana descended from the carriage
and sent the Pradh&acirc;n&icirc; home. What most astonished the prince
was the absence of male servants in that garden. At the entrance of the
road twenty young females of the most exquisite beauty waited and
conducted Kharavadana through the sweet bower to the mansion. When it
was reached, the minister sat down on a most richly furnished gold
couch, and ordered the females there to bring the queen. Ten females
arranged themselves on each side of an ivory palanquin, and started,
apparently, to bring the queen in it. &ldquo;These females themselves
resemble Rambh&acirc;,<a class="noteref" id="n64asrc" href="#n64a"
name="n64asrc">20</a> Urva&#347;&icirc;,<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n64a">20</a> &amp;c. A woman who has beauty superior to the heads of
these females must, of course, be of the greatest beauty imaginable in
this world. Let me see her.&rdquo; Thus thinking, the prince Sundara
anxiously awaited the return of the palanquin. In a few minutes it
came. A female of the most charming beauty jumped briskly out of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>it. The minister came running to give his helping
hand to her. Horror of horrors, what sees the prince! It was his own
wife, the very girl that the minister had married to him a few years
before, that got down from the palanquin. &ldquo;Are my eyes deceived?
Do they perform their functions aright? Let me look once more.&rdquo;
So again and again wiping his eyes to clear them a little, the prince
saw distinctly. It was his very wife herself. &ldquo;Oh, I most
foolishly accused that grey-headed guardian for a wicked fool, because
he would not allow me to be friends with my wife. I now see what he saw
a long time ago. Perhaps if I had seen more of her I should have thus
been brought in here by some secret way that these devils seem now to
have to the inmost parts of the palace. If I had taken anything from
her hands I should have died that very day. My poor old man, my
Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g it is, who has saved me from all these
calamities.&rdquo; These thoughts and a thousand more were passing
through Sundara&rsquo;s mind when he saw his wife sitting down on the
same couch with the minister. She accused him of the delay in murdering
her husband, of his letting all opportunities escape during the morning
ride. &ldquo;Horrible! Did you, Kharavadana, marry me to such a
faithful wife! Thank God and Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g that I have
not fallen into her snares,&rdquo; thought Sundara to himself. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>minister offered a thousand excuses, related to
her all that had taken place between himself and the
Pradh&acirc;n&icirc;, and of what the latter had promised. Then they
both retired to bed. At that moment the treacherous owl began to hoot,
and one of the maid-servants, who happened to be a clever interpreter
of owl-hootings revealed, to secure the favour of the minister, that
the prince was lurking behind a tree in that very garden. Knowing the
price set on Sundara&rsquo;s head even female hands flew to cut it off.
All ran with torches to search the garden.</p>
<p>These words, of course, fell upon the ears of the prince like
thunder. Before the people there began their search he began his race,
jumped over a high wall, and flew like a kite. Before the lady-racers
and the minister had left their sweet road to the tank-bank, Sundara
found himself in the north street of the town. The news that the prince
was out that night spread like a flame from the pleasure-park outside
throughout the whole town, and before long avaricious persons were
searching in the streets for his valuable head. Sundara thought it
dangerous to pass through the streets, and wished to hide himself in a
safe place. Fortune conducted him to one. It was a ruined old choultry,
where food, during the days of his father, was distributed in charity
to the beggars of the town, and which was now only resorted to by them
to sleep, and not to receive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>rice. The prince entered it, and laid
himself down in the midst of them, fortunately unobserved. He could
hear from where he was the noise of the persons searching outside. In
the garden the minister searched in vain, and accusing the female for
her wrong interpretation as he thought, retired to bed.</p>
<p>Outside the north gate, at a distance of three <i><span class="corr"
id="xd26e1198" title=
"Source: gha&#7789;ikas&rsquo;">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s&rsquo;</span></i>
walk, lived a robber. He used to start out on a plundering expedition
once in seven years. In the houses and mansions he used to rob he took
only jewels of various kinds, <i>G&ocirc;m&ecirc;da</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1204src" href="#xd26e1204" name=
"xd26e1204src">21</a> <i>pushpar&ucirc;ga</i>, (topaz)
<i>vajra</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1214src" href="#xd26e1214"
name="xd26e1214src">22</a> <i>vai&#7693;&ucirc;rya</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1220src" href="#xd26e1220" name=
"xd26e1220src">23</a> &amp;c.; gold and silver he rejected as being too
mean for his dignity. As he was a high-caste robber, he used to take a
coolie with him on his way to carry his booty. Of course, that coolie
never returned from the cave. He was put to death after his services
were over, lest he should disclose the secret of the robber.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that new-moon night happened to be the night of that
cruel robber&rsquo;s plundering expedition. He came out, and when he
saw people in search of the prince, thinking that he was not in his
palace, he wanted to plunder it. Wishing for a coolie, he entered the
ruined choultry, to pick <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href=
"#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>out one among the beggars there.
Passing over the others he came to the prince. He found him stout and
strong. &ldquo;This beggar will do me good service to-day. I shall
break my custom, and amply reward this man for his services.&rdquo; So
thinking to himself, the gentleman robber tapped Sundara with his cane
on the back. The prince had just closed his eyes. In the short sleep
that ensued he dreamt that the minister&rsquo;s servants were pursuing
him, and that one had caught him. At that very moment the
gentleman-robber&rsquo;s stroke fell upon his back, giving a sort of
reality to his dream. He awoke with horror. &ldquo;Tell me who you
are,&rdquo; asked the unknown person, &ldquo;A beggar,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;How does the night appear to you?&rdquo; asked the
robber. &ldquo;As dark as dark can be,&rdquo; replied the prince. The
robber applied a sort of <i>kajjala</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1229src" href="#xd26e1229" name="xd26e1229src">24</a> to the
prince&rsquo;s eyes, and asked, &ldquo;How does the night appear
now?&rdquo; &ldquo;As luminous as if a <i>kar&ocirc;&#7771;</i> of suns
were in the sky,&rdquo; answered Sundara. The robber applied a
<i>tilaka</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1240src" href="#xd26e1240"
name="xd26e1240src">25</a> to the intended coolie&rsquo;s forehead and
addressed him thus: &ldquo;I am a robber, now going to plunder the
palace, from which the prince is absent. Follow me. I shall reward you
richly. The <i>kajjala</i> has made the night a day to you. The
<i>tilaka</i> takes you unobserved <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58"
href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>wherever you wish to go.&rdquo;
So saying, and dragging the coolie or supposed coolie by the hand, the
robber went off to the palace. Wherever he found a door locked, he
applied a leaf that he carried in his hand to the fastening, and
behold, the lock flew back, and the door opened of its own accord. The
prince was astonished. In a few minutes the robber opened one and all
of the gates and boxes, and extracted all the precious stones. He tied
them up in a bundle, and set it on the prince&rsquo;s head, and asked
him to follow. Sundara followed. He assisted in the plunder of his own
palace, and carried the booty behind the robber, who, praised be his
stupidity, never for one moment suspected he was a prince, but admired
his coolie for the beauty of his person, thought of saving his life,
and also of making him his son-in-law. For the robber had a beautiful
daughter, for whom he had long been searching for a suitable husband.
So with this thought he reached the cave, stopped before it, and taking
the bundle from the prince&rsquo;s head ordered him to go into a large
cell, the mouth of which he covered with a big stone, which he lifted
up by pronouncing an incantation over it. The robber went with the
bundle to his wife, and described to her the beauty of the coolie, and
what a fair match he would be for their daughter. The wife did not like
it, and asked her husband to do with the coolie <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>as they
usually did, <i>i.e.</i>, murder him; and the robber, who never in
anything acted against the will of his wife, went in to fetch his
weapon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the robber&rsquo;s daughter, an excellent girl, of the
most charming beauty, overhearing all that took place between her
parents, came running to the cave where the coolie was confined. She
pronounced a single word over the stone lid of the cave, and it opened,
and the prince, who had lost all hopes of recovery, now beheld a
beautiful girl coming towards him. &ldquo;Whoever you may be, my dear
coolie, fly for your life for the present. You are my husband. My
father has so named you, but as my mother does not like it, he has gone
to fetch his weapon to murder you. Excepting we three, none, not even
Brahm&acirc;, can open the once-shut gates. After hearing you once
called my husband, I must ever regard you so. Now fly, and escape my
father&rsquo;s sharp sword. If you are a man, marry me in kind
remembrance of the assistance rendered. If you fail to do so you are a
beast, and I shall die a virgin.&rdquo; So saying she conducted out in
haste the supposed coolie, who had only time to take a hasty embrace,
whispering in her ear that he was the prince, and that he would marry
her without fail. He now ran for his life. Fearing the robber would
come after him he left the way by which he reached the cave, and
passing through unknown fields <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60"
href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>reached the south gate of the
town. By that time the search for him had almost abated, and the
prince, praising God for his delivery, reached the south street. The
night was almost spent. Before returning to the palace he wished to
take rest for a few minutes, till he had recovered his breath, and so
he sat down on the pyal of an old and almost ruined house.</p>
<p>That happened to be the house of a poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, who had
not even sufficient clothes to wear. As the prince sat down in a corner
of the pyal the door of the house opened, and the old
Br&acirc;hma&#7751; came out. The old woman, the
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&icirc;, was standing at the door with a vessel
containing water for her husband.
&#346;ubh&acirc;&#347;&acirc;str&icirc;, for that was the
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&rsquo;s name, looked up to the sky for a couple of
minutes, after which he heaved a deep sigh, and said, &ldquo;Alas, the
prince, the only son of our former protector, <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1263" title=
"Source: Siv&acirc;ch&acirc;r">&#346;iv&acirc;ch&acirc;r</span>, is not
to remain for more than two <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e1267" title=
"Source: gha&#7789;ikas">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</span></i>. A
<i>k&acirc;lasarpa</i> (black serpent) will sting him. What shall we
do? We are poor. If we could begin <i>Sarpah&ocirc;ma</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1275src" href="#xd26e1275" name=
"xd26e1275src">26</a> now we could tie the mouth of the snake,
sacrifice it in the fire, and thus save the prince.&rdquo; So saying
the poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751; cried. Sundara, who overheard everything,
jumped down in confusion, and fell at the feet of the
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, who asked him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61"
href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>who he was. &ldquo;I am a
herdsman of the palace. Preserve my master&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; was the
reply. &#346;ubh&acirc;&#347;&acirc;str&icirc; was extremely poor. He
had no means to procure a small quantity of <i>gh&icirc;</i> even to
begin the <i>h&ocirc;ma</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1287src" href=
"#xd26e1287" name="xd26e1287src">27</a> He did not know what to do. He
begged from his neighbours, who all laughed at his stupidity, and
ridiculed his astrology. The prince in a hopeless state of anguish
wrung his hands, and in wringing them he felt his ring. Drawing it off
his finger he gave it to &#346;ubh&acirc;&#347;&acirc;str&icirc;, and
requested him to pawn it. The latter resorted to the nearest
b&acirc;z&acirc;r, and awakening the b&acirc;z&acirc;r-keeper procured
from him a little <i>gh&icirc;</i>, by pawning the ring. Running home
and bathing in cold water the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; sat down for the
<i>h&ocirc;ma</i>. The prince, fearing the serpent, wished to sit
inside the house, but at a distance from the place of the ceremony.
Just at the appointed hour a large black serpent broke through the sky,
fell on the head of the prince, whom he was not able to bite, and gave
up its life in the fire. &ldquo;This is no shepherd, but the very
prince himself,&rdquo; said the Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&icirc;.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1296src" href="#xd26e1296" name=
"xd26e1296src">28</a> Sundara rose up, and running surrounded them
thrice, spoke to them thus:&mdash;&ldquo;You alone are my parents and
protectors. This night has been a most adventurous one with me. There
was every possibility of my escaping every other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>calamity, and so I did. But no other power except
yours could have averted this snake-bite. So my rescue is due to you
alone. I have no time to lose now. Before daylight I must fly
unobserved to the palace, and you shall before long see my reward for
this.&rdquo; So saying, Sundara ran to his palace and entered.</p>
<p>Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g was almost dead. The rumour that the
prince was out reached him. He was astonished at the way in which
Sundara had got out. He searched the whole palace. To his astonishment
all the rooms had previously been opened and plundered. &ldquo;Has the
prince been stolen away by some vile tricks from the palace,&rdquo;
thought Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g, and without knowing what to do
he was buried in the ocean of sorrow, from which he gave up all hopes
of recovering. What was his joy, then, when he saw the prince enter the
palace just at dawn. &ldquo;<i>Mai B&acirc;b Chakravarti</i>,
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1307" title="Source: were">where</span>
have you been the whole night, throwing away the advice of your poor
slave? How many enemies you have in this world, you have yet to
know,&rdquo; said Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g. &ldquo;I know them
all now, only listen to what I say, and do as I bid. I have won the
crown without a blow. Thank the day that gave me you as my protector,
for it was only yesterday that I had ample reason to verify your
statements. My adventures would make your hair stand on end. Thank God
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>I have escaped from all of them unhurt. If you
have a few men ready now, we have won the kingdom.&rdquo; So saying,
the prince explained to him every detail of his adventure. &ldquo;If we
catch hold of the minister now, we have done all.&rdquo; &ldquo;I could
never for one moment think that you in a single night could have seen
and done so much. Now that heaven has shown you the way, I shall obey
you,&rdquo; said Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g, and Sundara
accordingly issued the orders. He described the house with the pyal at
which he had lingered for a while the previous night, and asked a
servant to bring the owner of that house to the R&acirc;jasth&acirc;nik
office. Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g brought in the
Pradh&acirc;n&icirc;, who was extremely delighted at the good
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1312" title=
"Source: intenton">intention</span> of the prince. He was offered the
Mantr&icirc;&rsquo;s place. Two were sent to the shepherds. Twenty were
sent to the pleasure-park to have the minister and his sweet paramour
brought to the court in chains. The female servants were also ordered
to be brought. The robber and his cruel wife were not forgotten. The
prince minutely described the cave, and asked his servants to catch and
imprison the robber by surprising him suddenly, without giving him time
to have recourse to his vile tricks&mdash;lock-breaking <i>kajjala</i>,
&amp;c. The palace palanquin was sent for the robber&rsquo;s daughter,
whom the prince had firmly made up his mind to marry. The palace
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>elephants were decked and sent to fetch with all
pomp &#346;ubh&acirc;&#347;&acirc;str&icirc; and his wife to the court.
Thus, without a single stroke, Sundara won the kingdom.
Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g was thunder-struck by the excellent and
bold way in which the prince in one night went through the series of
calamities, and successfully overcame them all. The
Pradh&acirc;n&icirc;&rsquo;s delight knew no bounds. He himself broke
open the court and every one connected with the previous night&rsquo;s
adventure was ushered in. The prince bathed, offered up his prayers,
and attended the council. When &#346;ubh&acirc;&#347;&acirc;str&icirc;
came in with his wife the prince put them on the
<i>simh&acirc;sana</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1324src" href=
"#xd26e1324" name="xd26e1324src">29</a> and himself standing before
them, explained to all his previous night&rsquo;s adventures, rewarded
the poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751; and the shepherds, punished by banishment
the maid-servant who, knowing that the prince&rsquo;s head was coveted,
revealed his concealment, and ordered his wife, the minister, the
robber, and the robber&rsquo;s wife to be beheaded. He rewarded without
limit his protector, &#346;ubh&acirc;&#347;&acirc;str&icirc;, and
married the robber&rsquo;s daughter, being won over by her sincerity.
The Pradh&acirc;n&icirc;, as we have said already, he made his
minister, and with his old guardian, the faithful
Ra&#7751;av&icirc;rasi&#7749;g, the prince reigned for several years in
the kingdom of Va&ntilde;jaim&acirc;nagar. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Dharmam&ecirc; jayam.</i></p>
<p>In the town of T&ecirc;vai<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1339src" href=
"#xd26e1339" name="xd26e1339src">1</a> there lived a king called
Sugu&#7751;a. He had an excellent minister named Dharma&#347;&icirc;la.
They ruled for a long time in prosperity over the kingdom. Both of them
had sons. The prince&rsquo;s name was Subuddhi. He was a noble prince,
and quite in keeping with his name, was always bent upon doing good to
the world. The minister&rsquo;s son was named Durbuddhi, a most wicked
boy, whose only delight was teasing beasts and birds from his infancy,
and which ripened into all sorts of wickedness as he grew to boyhood.
Notwithstanding the difference between their temperaments the prince
and the minister&rsquo;s son were the best of friends. The motto of the
prince was <i>Dharmam&ecirc; jayam</i>&mdash;Charity alone conquers.
That of the minister&rsquo;s son was <i>Adharmam&ecirc;
jayam</i>&mdash;Absence of Charity alone conquers. When rising
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>from their beds, when beginning their prayers,
when sitting down for meals or study, and, in fact, before beginning to
do anything, each repeated his motto. The people had great hopes in
Subuddhi, whom they fully expected to see a good and benevolent king;
but the minister&rsquo;s son all thoroughly hated. Even the minister
himself, his father, hated his son for his vile turn of mind, which he
found impossible to change. His only friend, as we have already said,
was the prince, who, notwithstanding all his faults, loved him
sincerely. Both of them had grown up together from their very cradle,
had played in the same dust, had read their lessons side by side in the
same school under the same teachers. Fortune so ordained that the
prince&rsquo;s mind should take such a bent, while the mind of the
minister&rsquo;s son turned in a crooked way.</p>
<p>Nor was Durbuddhi insensible to the disgust and dislike which every
one manifested towards him. He was well aware of all that was going on
around. Still he would not change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no friend in this world excepting yourself, my dear
Subuddhi,&rdquo; exclaimed Durbuddhi one day to his royal friend while
they were riding together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear nothing. I shall ever stand by you as your true
friend,&rdquo; replied Subuddhi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My very father hates me. Who else would like me then? On the
other hand, every one likes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href=
"#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>you. You may soon get yourself
married to some beautiful lady, while I must remain a bachelor; for no
girl would marry me. You may soon rise to the place of a king; but I
cannot become your minister, as the people do not like me. What can I
do?&rdquo; So said the minister&rsquo;s son, and hung down his head, as
if conscious for a time of the utter hatred with which the people
regarded him.</p>
<p>Subuddhi replied, &ldquo;Heed it not, I will make you my minister,
give you everything you want, and see you well provided for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, will you give me your wife one day, at least, if you
happen to get married before me, and if I remain a bachelor after
you,&rdquo; were the words which the wretched Durbuddhi shamelessly
uttered to the face of his only friend.</p>
<p>These words were enough in themselves to enrage the prince&rsquo;s
mind. But he was of so good a nature that instead of becoming angry, he
smiled at the stupidity of his companion, and agreed that he would thus
give him his wife one day in case he got married first. Thus took place
an agreement between Subuddhi and Durbuddhi while they were still quite
young.</p>
<p>Several years passed after this agreement, when one day the prince
went to hunt in a neighbouring forest. His inseparable companion, the
minister&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>son, and several hunters followed him to the wood.
The prince and the minister&rsquo;s son both gave chase to a deer. They
rode so much in advance of the hunters that they lost themselves in a
thick jungle, where the latter could neither see nor follow them. The
hunters returned after dark, and informed the king and the minister
about the disappearance of their sons. They thought that as their sons
were grown-up men they need not fear for their safety.</p>
<p>The two friends chased the deer and found themselves in the midst of
a thick forest in the evening. Except a slight breakfast in the early
morning they had tasted no other food. Hunger was pinching them
severely. The hot chase had awakened a severe thirst, to quench which
they were not able to find a drop of water. In utter hopelessness of
life they resigned themselves to the course of their steeds. The beasts
seemed very well to understand the wants of their royal riders. They
went on trotting, and at last, about midnight, stopped on the banks of
a large tank.</p>
<p>The riders, who were almost dead with thirst, opened their closed
eyes when the horses stopped. All of a sudden, and to their great joy,
they found themselves on the banks of a large tank. Their joy knew no
bounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely God takes care of His children. Had it not been for
His kind care how could we have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69"
href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>come to this tank, when we had
given ourselves up to the guidance of our horses?&rdquo; thought
Subuddhi to himself, and got down from his horse.</p>
<p>The minister&rsquo;s son, who had become more exhausted by that time
than his companion, also alighted. Subuddhi, true to the nobility of
his mind, took both the steeds first to water, and, after satisfying
their thirst and loosening them to graze by the side of a grassy
meadow, he went into the water to quench his thirst. The
minister&rsquo;s son also followed. After a short prayer Subuddhi took
some handfuls of water, and returned to the bank. Durbuddhi also
returned. They chose a clean spot, and sat down to rest during the
remaining part of the night. The prince, when taking his seat,
pronounced his usual motto, &ldquo;Charity alone conquers,&rdquo; and
the minister&rsquo;s son also repeated his, &ldquo;Absence of Charity
alone conquers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words fell like venom into the ears of the prince at that
time. He could not control his anger then, notwithstanding his mild
disposition. The hardships of the day, their fortunate arrival on a
tank in the dead of night to have their thirst quenched, were fresh in
Subuddhi&rsquo;s mind, and the prayers that he was offering to God were
not yet over. That the minister&rsquo;s son should never think of all
this, and go on with his own stupid motto even at that time was
intolerable to Subuddhi. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href=
"#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Vile wretch! detested atheist! have you no shame, to utter
your wicked motto even after such calamities? It is not too late even
now. Mend your character. Think of the God that saved you just now.
Believe in Him. Change your motto from this day.&rdquo; Thus spoke the
angry prince to the minister&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>Durbuddhi, who was naturally of a wicked and quarrelsome
temperament, flew into a rage at once at the excellent advice of the
prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop your mouth. I know as well as you do; you cannot wag
your tail here. I can oppose you single-handed in this
forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus saying, the minister&rsquo;s son sprang like an enraged lion at
Subuddhi, who, as he never dreamt of any such thing, was completely
overpowered by the wicked Durbuddhi. The prince was thrown down in the
twinkling of an eye, and the minister&rsquo;s son was upon him. He
severely thrashed his royal master, and, taking hold of a twig that was
lying close by, tore out the prince&rsquo;s two eyes, filled up the
sockets with sand, and ran away with his horse, thinking that he had
completely killed him.</p>
<p>Subuddhi was almost dead; his body was bruised all over; his eyes
were no more; his physical pain was unbearable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a God over us all?&rdquo; thought Subuddhi. The
night was almost over. The cool and sweet <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>breeze of the morning
gave him some strength. He rose up, and, crawling on the ground, felt
his way to the entrance of a temple. He crept in, shut <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e1399" title="Not in source">the</span> gates, and
fastened the bolt.</p>
<p>It happened to be a temple of the fierce <i>K&acirc;l&icirc;</i>.
She used to go out every morning to gather roots and fruits, and to
return at evening. That day, when she returned, she found her gates
shut against her. She threatened with destruction the usurper of her
temple. A voice, and we know that it was Subuddhi&rsquo;s, replied from
within:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am already dying of the loss of my eyes. So, if in anger
you kill me, it is so much the better; for what use is there in my
living blind? If, on the contrary, you pity me, and by your divine
power give me my eyes, I shall open the gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>K&acirc;l&icirc; was in a very difficult position. She was very
hungry, and saw no other way of going inside than by giving Subuddhi
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the gates; your request is granted,&rdquo; said
K&acirc;l&icirc;. No sooner were these words uttered than the prince
recovered his eyes. His delight may be better imagined than described.
He opened the gates and vowed before K&acirc;l&icirc; that he would
from that day continue in that temple as her servant and
worshipper.</p>
<p>The wretched Durbuddhi, after his horrible act, rode on composedly,
following the footsteps of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72"
href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>horse, and reached the forest
where he had been hunting the day before in company with the prince. He
thence returned home all alone. When his father saw him coming back he
suspected something wrong to the prince, and asked his son what had
become of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We chased a deer, and he rode so much in advance of me that
he was out of sight, and finding all search vain, I returned
alone,&rdquo; was Durbuddhi&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This I would have believed from anyone but yourself. Never
plant your feet in these dominions till you bring back the prince
again. Run for your life,&rdquo; was the order of the minister, and
Durbuddhi accordingly ran off, fearing the anger of his father.</p>
<p>Thus the Prince Subuddhi served in the K&acirc;l&icirc; temple; and
Durbuddhi, fully confident that he had killed his friend, roamed about
from place to place, as he saw no possibility of returning to his own
country without the prince.</p>
<p>Thus passed several months. The goddess K&acirc;l&icirc; was
extremely delighted at the sincere devotion of Subuddhi, and, calling
him one day to her side, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son! I am delighted with your great devotion to me. Enough
of your menial services here. Better return now to your kingdom. Your
parents are likely to be much vexed at your loss. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>Go and
console their minds.&rdquo; Thus ended K&acirc;l&icirc;, and Subuddhi
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, my goddess, my mother, I no more regard them as my
parents. This wood is not a large place if they wished to search for
me. As they were so careless about me, I shall also from this day
disregard them. You are my father and mother. Therefore permit me to
end my days here in your service.&rdquo; So saying, Subuddhi begged
K&acirc;l&icirc; to allow him to stay, and the goddess agreed
accordingly, for some time at least.</p>
<p>After a few more months, K&acirc;l&icirc; called the prince again to
her, and addressed him thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy! I have devised another plan. Better not, then, go to
your parents, as you do not wish to go now. At a short distance from
this place, in the K&acirc;v&ecirc;r&icirc; country, reigns a staunch
devotee of mine. His daughter had small-pox, and as he forgot to do
proper respect to me, I have blinded both her eyes. The king has issued
a proclamation that he will give the whole kingdom and his daughter in
marriage to him who would cure her of her defect. He has hung up a bell
(<i>gha&#7751;&#7789;&acirc;</i>) at which every physician who wishes
to try the case strikes. The king comes running as soon as he hears the
sound, takes home the doctor and shows him the case. Several persons
have tried in vain; for who could repair a defect inflicted by the
displeasure of the gods? Now I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74"
href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>mean to send you there. That
king is a staunch worshipper of my feet. Though I have punished him,
still I pity the sad calamity that has come upon his daughter. You had
better go there and strike the bell. He will take you and show you the
case. For three consecutive days apply my holy ashes to her eyes.
Though fools may deride these ashes, still by them a true devotee can
work wonders. On the fourth day her eyes will be perfectly restored.
Then you will secure her hand, and, what is more, the country of
K&acirc;v&ecirc;r&icirc;. Reign there, for you are born to reign, being
a prince, and not to spend your time here in this wood. If you do not
do so you will commit a sin, and, what is more, incur my
displeasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus ended K&acirc;l&icirc;, and the prince could not refuse; for he
feared the anger of the goddess. Agreeing to her words, and with her
manifold blessings, he started and reached the kingdom of
K&acirc;v&ecirc;r&icirc;.</p>
<p>He struck the bell. The king came running to welcome the new doctor.
All the previous physicians had tried by medicines external and
internal. The new doctor&mdash;Prince Subuddhi&mdash;proposed to treat
the case by <i>mantras</i>&mdash;incantations. The old king, who was
very religious, fully believed that the new doctor might effect the
cure, and, just as he expected, on the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1448" title="Source: forrth">fourth</span> day his
daughter&rsquo;s sight was completely restored. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>king&rsquo;s joy knew no bounds. He enquired into
the parentage of the doctor: and when he came to know that he had
princely blood in his veins, that he was as honourably descended as
himself, his joy was greatly increased. He sent up a thousand prayers
to the god for giving him a royal son-in-law. As promised in his
notice, he would have to give his daughter to anyone, whatever he might
be, who effected the cure. The lowest beggar, the lowest caste-man, if
he had only succeeded in curing her, would have had as much claim to
her hand as the prince-physician. So when the person that effected the
cure proved to be a prince, the king was extremely delighted, and at
once made all arrangements for the marriage of his daughter, and gave
her to Subuddhi: and, himself being very old, he gave the kingdom also
to the prince at the same time.</p>
<p>Thus by the favour of K&acirc;l&icirc;, Subuddhi had a princess for
his wife and a kingdom to govern. Subuddhi, as we know, was an
excellent man. Though he became king now, he consulted his
father-in-law in all matters, and, in fact, acted only as manager for
the old man. Every evening he used to consult him for an hour or two
before disposing of intricate cases. The duty of signing, too, he
reserved for the old man. Thus even on those days when there were no
cases he used to go to his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href=
"#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>father-in-law to get papers signed.
Thus passed on a couple of years or so.</p>
<p>One evening, while sitting in company with his wife in the loftiest
room of his palace after the duties of the day, he cast his eyes to the
east main street and contemplated the bustle of that part of the town.
Carts creaking under the load of merchandise, the flourish with which
the goods and wares were exposed for sale, fashionable gentlemen in
their fanciful evening costumes walking to and fro, the troublesome
hawkers that stand by the roadside questioning every one as to what
they would buy, and several other things interested him, and for a time
made him somewhat proud even, that he ruled over such a rich country.
But sweetness is not always unaccompanied with bitterness. He saw in
that same street a man whose face was very familiar to him, but whom he
could not at once make out. A black man was sitting on a projecting
pyal of a corner of a shop, and was mending some torn gunny bags.
Subuddhi looked at him carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it the minister&rsquo;s son, Durbuddhi? No; he is not so
black; rather was not when I saw him last,&rdquo; thought Subuddhi with
himself, and examining his face, he at last exclaimed, &ldquo;It is he!
It is he! It is my friend and companion.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is
it?&rdquo; exclaimed the princess, and rushed at once to his side. She
had most carefully watched her husband&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>face for
the past few minutes while he was in deep contemplation. &ldquo;It is
my friend, the minister&rsquo;s son, by name Durbuddhi. We were
companions from our birth; we played in the same dust, read in the same
school, and were ever inseparable companions. I do not know what has
brought him to the condition in which I see him now,&rdquo; said
Subuddhi, and sent some one to fetch him. Of the wicked and base act of
the vile Durbuddhi he did not care to inform his gentle wife, who now
retired to her inner apartments, as decorum did not allow her to be in
company with her husband when he was receiving others.</p>
<p>The persons sent brought in Durbuddhi. Whatever might have been the
cruelty that he had received from the hands of the minister&rsquo;s
son, the prince began to shed tears when he saw his old companion
ushered in, not in that blooming cheerful red complexion in which he
had seen him last, but in a weather-beaten dark skin and dejected
colour of a <span class="corr" id="xd26e1465" title=
"Source: cooly">coolie</span> in which he saw him a few minutes
ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I excuse you all your faults, my dear Durbuddhi. Tell me
quickly what has brought you to this wretched plight,&rdquo; asked
Subuddhi, and while asking he began to cry aloud. The minister&rsquo;s
son also shed tears copiously, and cried or pretended to cry; for be it
known that he was a perfect scoundrel, born to no good in the world.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My own mischief has brought me to this plight. When I
returned to our country, after putting out your eyes and thinking that
I had killed you, my father banished me from our dominions, and ordered
me never to plant my feet within their limits without bringing you
back. As I thought I had put an end to your life I never came back to
that tank in search of you. I engaged myself as a <span class="corr"
id="xd26e1473" title="Source: cooly">coolie</span> in the streets of
this town after trying several other places without success, and I now
stand before you.&rdquo; Thus ended Durbuddhi, and the prince quite
forgot his cruelty to him. He ordered his servants to get the
minister&rsquo;s son bathed, and attired in as rich robes as he himself
wore. Then he related to him his own story, without omitting a single
point, and at once made him his minister.</p>
<p>The whole story of Durbuddhi, excepting the single point of his
having put out his eyes, the prince related to his wife, father, and
mother-in-law.</p>
<p>Thus was Durbuddhi again restored to his high position, through the
liberal kindness of Subuddhi. Subuddhi did not stop even at this. He
began to send him with papers and other things to the old king for
signature. This went on for some months. All the while Durbuddhi was as
obedient as might be, and by his vile tricks had completely won over
the heart of the old king. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href=
"#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>One evening, after the signatures were over, Durbuddhi stopped for a
while as if desirous to speak. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; said the
old king. &ldquo;Nothing but your favour,&rdquo; was the only reply,
after which he retired. Thus he went on for some days and weeks. Every
day he stopped for a few minutes after the state business was over, and
when the old king asked the reason for it went on giving evasive
answers. At last one evening the old king was extremely provoked. The
cunning Durbuddhi had purposely intended this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a big fool are you to stop every day as if wishing to
speak and never to utter a word,&rdquo; broke out the old king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon of your honour; I was thinking all the while
whether I should let out my secret or not. At last, I have come to the
conclusion that I will keep it to myself,&rdquo; replied the diabolical
Durbuddhi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you shall let it out,&rdquo; roared the old king, whose
curiosity was more roused than abated by the words, purposely obscure,
of the minister&rsquo;s son. Durbuddhi, after simulating much
reluctance at disclosing the supposed secret, loudly began his
harangue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord, ever since I came here I have been making enquiries
about the nobility of your family, about the sacrifices that you and
your ancestors have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80"
name="pb80">80</a>]</span>performed, about the purifications that you
and your elders have undergone, and about a thousand other particulars,
each of which is enough to secure you and your descendants the place of
Achyuta (<i>Achyutapada</i>) himself. These delighted me for a
time&mdash;I say for a time&mdash;for listen, please, to what follows.
When I compared with the pure fame of your famous family, that of your
son-in-law, my heart began to pain me. Indeed the pain which began at
that moment has not yet ceased. Know, then, that your son-in-law is not
a prince. No doubt he has royal blood in his veins, which makes him
look like a king. How came he to be so skilful in medicine. Just
enquire the cause. To be no more in the dark, the king of my
country&mdash;over which my father is the minister&mdash;set out one
day on <i>sav&acirc;r</i>. While passing a barber&rsquo;s street he saw
a beautiful damsel of that caste. Bewitched by her beauty the king
wanted to include her in his harem, notwithstanding her low position in
society. The child of that woman, is your son-in-law. He being the son
of a barber-mother acquired thus easily the art of medicine. That a
king was his father makes him look like a prince. If he had been of
pure birth why should he leave his kingdom, and come here to effect the
cure of your daughter? Except this prince, or supposed prince, all
those that came here were mere doctors by caste.&rdquo; Thus ended the
vile Durbuddhi, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81"
name="pb81">81</a>]</span>taking in his hand the papers, vanished out
of the room quickly, like a serpent that had stung.</p>
<p>The sweet words in which the minister&rsquo;s son clothed his
arguments, the rising passion at the thought that he had been falsely
imposed upon by a barber&rsquo;s son, the shame&mdash;or rather
supposed shame&mdash;that he thought had come over his family, and a
thousand other feelings clouded for a time the clear reason of the old
king. He saw no other way of putting an end to the shame than by the
murder of his dear daughter and son-in-law first, and of his own self
and queen afterwards. At once he sent for the executioner, who came in.
He gave him his signet-ring, and commanded him to break open the
bed-room of his son-in-law that midnight, and murder him with his wife
while asleep. The <i>hukums</i>, or orders given with signet-rings, can
never be disobeyed. The executioner humbled himself to the ground, as a
sign of his accepting the order, and retired to sharpen his knife for
his terrible duty.</p>
<p>Neither Subuddhi nor his affectionate wife had any reason to suspect
this terrible mandate. The old queen and the treacherous Durbuddhi had
equally no reason to know anything about it. The old man, after issuing
the <i>hukum</i>, shut himself up in his closet, and began to weep and
wail as if he had lost his daughter from that moment. Durbuddhi, after
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>kindling the fire, as says the Tamil proverb, by
means of his treachery, came back with the papers to the prince. A
thought occurred in his mind that Subuddhi&rsquo;s fate was drawing
near. He wanted to carry out the agreement between himself and the
prince about the latter&rsquo;s wife. The excellent Subuddhi, who
always observed oaths most strictly, was confused for a time. He did
not know what to do. To stick to the oath and surrender his wife to
another; or to break it and preserve the chastity of his own wife. At
last, repeating in his own mind, &ldquo;Charity alone conquers,&rdquo;
and also thinking that Heaven would somehow devise to preserve his
wife, he went to her, explained to her how the matter stood, and
ordered her to go to the minister&rsquo;s son. She hesitatingly
consented; for, as a good wife, she could not disobey her
husband&rsquo;s commands. Subuddhi then told Durbuddhi that he might
have his wife as his own.</p>
<p>The princess went to her mother, crying that her husband had turned
out mad. &ldquo;Or else who would promise to give his wife to another.
What does he mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter! fear nothing, perhaps, in his boyhood, he made
this rash promise without thinking. The promise once made now pains
him. Unable to break it, and leaving it to yourself to preserve your
chastity, he has so ordered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=
"#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>you. And he would, nay must, excuse
you, if you by some means or other save yourself, and apparently make
good your husband&rsquo;s promise also. A thought just comes to me how
to do that. There is your foster-sister, exactly resembling you. I
shall send her in your place.&rdquo; So consoling her daughter, the old
queen at once made all the requisite arrangements. And, of course,
Subuddhi had no reason then to know anything about them.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night his door is forced open, and a ruffian
with a drawn sword, blazing like lightning, rushes in, and murders the
pair. Thus in that very night in which Durbuddhi had reached the
topmost point of his vice, he was cut down by the supreme hand of God.
For, it is said, that when crime increases, God himself cannot tolerate
it.</p>
<p>The morning dawned. Subuddhi rose from his couch, and after his
morning prayers was sitting in the council hall. The princess and her
mother rose from their beds, and were attending to their business. A
servant just at that time came running to the old queen, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our king is weeping in his room that his daughter is now no
more. I think that there is something wrong with his majesty&rsquo;s
brains to-day. Come and console him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The queen, who knew nothing of what had happened, ran to her
husband&rsquo;s room, quite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href=
"#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>astonished at the change. The husband
reported everything to her&mdash;the sage-looking minister&rsquo;s son,
the barber&rsquo;s son-in-law, and everything, and then concluded that
their daughter and son-in-law were no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! compose yourself. Our son-in-law is sitting in his
durbar. Our daughter is just adorning herself in her dressing-room.
Were you dreaming? Are you in your right senses?&rdquo; said the
queen.</p>
<p>The king ordered the executioner to bring the heads, which, on
examination, proved to be those of the minister&rsquo;s son and of the
foster-sister. The queen told everything of the one-day-wife-giving
engagement, and her own arrangements about it. The old king could not
understand what all this meant. He drew out his sword and ran to the
durbar like a maddened lion, and stood armed before his son-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relate to me your true origin, and everything respecting
yourself. Speak the truth. How came you to learn medicine? If you are a
prince why should you leave your own dominions and come down here? What
about this wicked agreement of giving your wife to another? Who is this
minister&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subuddhi, without omitting a single point, related everything that
had taken place, even to the putting out of his eyes. The old man threw
down <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>his sword, took his son-in-law in his arms almost,
for so great was his joy at the excellent way which fate had prepared
for his escape, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, my life, my eye. True it is, true it is.
<i>Dharma</i> alone conquers, and you that hold that motto have
conquered everything. The vile wretch whom, notwithstanding the series
of rogueries that he practised upon you, you protected, has at last
found out that his <i>Adharmam</i> never conquers. But he never found
it out. It was his <i>Adharmam</i> that cut him off on the very night
of his supposed complete conquest by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Letters were sent at once to T&ecirc;vai, inviting <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e1554" title="Source: Suguna">Sugu&#7751;a</span> and
Dharma&#347;&icirc;la to the happy rejoicings at the prince and
princess&rsquo;s delivery, and a re-marriage was celebrated with all
pomp, in honour of their lucky escape. Dharma&#347;&icirc;la, as he
disliked his son, never shed a single tear for his loss. Subuddhi lived
for a long time, giving much consolation to his own and his
wife&rsquo;s parents. Through the blessings of K&acirc;l&icirc; they
had several intelligent sons. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain town there lived a clever old
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, named Won&rsquo;t-Give.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1567src" href="#xd26e1567" name="xd26e1567src">1</a> He used to
go out daily and to beg in all the houses round, under the pretence
that he had to feed several Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s in his own house. Good
people, that believed in his words, used to give him much rice and
curry stuffs, with which he would come home, and explain to his wife
how he had deceived such and such a gentleman by the imposition of
feeding in charity many persons at home. But if any hungry
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, who had heard of his empty boast of feeding
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s at home, came to him, he was sent away with some
excuse or other. In this way Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give brought home a
basketful of rice and other necessaries every day, of which he only
used a small portion for himself and his wife, and converted the
remainder into money. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87"
name="pb87">87</a>]</span>And thus, by imposition and tricks, he
managed to live well for several years.</p>
<p>In an adjoining village there lived another very clever
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, named Won&rsquo;t-Leave.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1575src" href="#xd26e1575" name="xd26e1575src">2</a> Whenever he
found any man reluctant and unwilling to give him anything that he
begged of him, he would persist in bothering him until he had wrung
from him a dole. This Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Leave, hearing of the charity of
Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give, and his benevolent feeding of
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s, came to see him one day, and requested him to
give him a meal. Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give told him that for that day ten
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s had already been settled, and that if he came the
next day he would have his meal without fail. Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Leave
agreed to this, and left him for that day. Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give had, of
course, told him the very lie he was accustomed to tell all that
occasionally begged meals of him.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Leave was not so stupid as to be thus imposed
upon. He stood before Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give&rsquo;s door precisely at
the appointed <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</i> (hour) the next day, and
reminded the master of the house of his promise. Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give
had never before been taken at his word, and determined to send away
the impertinent guest by some stronger excuse than the first, and so he
spoke to him thus:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href=
"#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I am very sorry to say that my wife fell ill last night
of a strong fever, from which she has not yet recovered. Owing to this
unforeseen accident I have had to postpone my charitable feedings
(<i>sam&acirc;r&acirc;dhana</i>) till her recovery, so do not trouble
me, please, for some days more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Leave heard these words with an expression of
sincere, or rather, seemingly sincere, sorrow in his face, and
replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respected sir, I am very sorry for the illness of the
mistress of the house, but to give up charitable feeding of
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s on that account is a great sin. For the last ten
years I have been studying the art of cooking, and can now cook for
even several hundreds of Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s; so I can assist you now
in preparing the necessaries for the
<i>sam&acirc;r&acirc;dhana</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give could not refuse such a request, but he
deceitfully determined in his mind to get Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Leave to cook
for him, and then to drive him away without giving him his rice. And so
he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is a very good idea. I am much obliged to you for
your kind suggestion. Come in; let us cook together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the master of the house took Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Leave inside
and they both went into the kitchen, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>while the mistress of the
house, at the command of her husband, pretended to be ill.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give was a good liver, and prepared, with the
assistance of Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Leave, several good dishes. And then the
difficulty was to drive the fellow out, for the long-maintained rule of
never feeding a single Br&acirc;hma&#7751; must not be broken that day.
So, when the cooking was all over, the master of the house gave to Mr.
Won&rsquo;t-Leave a <i>k&acirc;&#347;u</i> (copper coin), and asked him
to bring some leaves from the <i>b&acirc;z&acirc;r</i> (for plates),
and he accordingly went. Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give, meanwhile, came to his
wife, and instructed her thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest wife, I have spared you the trouble of cooking
to-day. Would that we could get such stupid fools as this every day to
cook for us! I have now sent him out to fetch us some leaves, and it
won&rsquo;t look well if we shut our doors against him or drive him
away; so we must make him go away of his own accord. A thought has just
come into my mind as to how we can do it. As soon as he comes you shall
commence to quarrel with me. I shall then come to you and beat you, or,
rather, the ground near you, with both my hands, and you must continue
your abuse and cries. The guest will find this very disgusting, and
will leave us of his own accord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give had just finished when he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>saw Mr.
Won&rsquo;t-Leave returning with the leaves. The wife, as pre-arranged,
abused her husband right and left for his great imprudence and
over-liberality in feeding the Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s. Said she:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we to get on in the world if you thus empty the house
of everything we have in feeding big-bellied Br&acirc;hma&#7751;s? Must
you be so particular as to invite them, even when I am sick?&rdquo;
These, and a thousand similar expressions, were now launched at the
husband&rsquo;s head. He pretended not to hear it for a time, but at
last, apparently overcome by anger, he went in and with his hands gave
successive blows on the floor. At every blow on the floor the wife
cried out that she was being murdered, and that those who had mercy in
their hearts should come to her rescue.</p>
<p>Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Leave, from the court-yard of the house, listened to
what was taking place inside, but not wishing to interfere in a quarrel
between husband and wife, left matters to take their own course, and
got into the loft, where he hid himself, fearing that he would be
summoned as a witness to the quarrel.</p>
<p>After a time Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give came out of the room where he had
been beating the floor, and to his joy he could not find the guest. He
cautiously looked round him and saw no signs of Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Leave.
Of course, having had no reason to think <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>that his guest would be
sitting in the loft, he did not look up there; and even if he had done
so, he would not have found him, for he had hidden himself out of
sight.</p>
<p>Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give now carefully bolted the door, and his wife
came out and changed her dirty cloth for a clean one. Said her husband
to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last we have succeeded in driving him out; come, you too
must be hungry; let us have our dinner together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two leaves were spread on the ground, and all the dishes were
equally divided into them. Meanwhile Mr. <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1634" title="Source: Won&rsquo;t-leave">Won&rsquo;t-Leave</span>
was watching all that took place below him and, being himself very
hungry, was slyly watching for an opportunity to jump down. Mr.
Won&rsquo;t-Give, gloating over his trickery, said to his wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my love, did I not beat you without hurting you?&rdquo;
to which she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not continue to cry without shedding tears?&rdquo; when
suddenly there fell on their ears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did I not come to have my dinner without going
away?&rdquo; and down jumped Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Leave, from the loft, and
took his seat in front of the leaf spread by Mr. Won&rsquo;t-Give for
his wife. And Mr. <span class="corr" id="xd26e1644" title=
"Source: Wont-Give">Won&rsquo;t-Give</span>, though disappointed, was
highly pleased at the cleverness of his guest. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>This story is cited as the authority for three proverbs that have
come into use in Tamil.</p>
<ul lang="ta-latn">
<li>&ldquo;<i>N&ocirc;v&acirc;mal a&#7693;itten.</i>&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<i>Oy&acirc;mal aluden.</i>&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<i>P&ocirc;k&acirc;mal vand&ecirc;n.</i>&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>which represent the exchanges of politeness between the husband, the
wife, and the guest, quoted in the foregoing paragraphs. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Vayalvallan Kaiyavalla.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Mr. Mighty-of-his-Mouth and Mr.
Mighty-of-his-Hands.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In two adjoining villages there lived two famous men.
The one was called Mr. Mighty-of-his-mouth<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1679src" href="#xd26e1679" name="xd26e1679src">1</a>&mdash;one
that could accomplish wonders with words alone. The other was called
Mr. Mighty-of-his-hands<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1684src" href=
"#xd26e1684" name="xd26e1684src">2</a>&mdash;one who could make no use
of that glib instrument the tongue, but was able to bear burdens, cut
wood, and perform other physical labour.</p>
<p>It so happened that they agreed to live together in the house of the
Mr. Mighty-of-his-mouth, to try and see which of them was the superior.
They accordingly kept company for several months, till the great feast
of the nine nights (<i>navar&acirc;tr&icirc;</i>) came on. On the first
day of the feast Mr. Mighty-of-his-hands wanted to sacrifice a goat to
the goddess K&acirc;l&icirc;. So he said to Mr.
Mighty-of-his-mouth,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend, we both are mighty in our way, and so it
would be shameful for us to buy the goat, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>that we want to
sacrifice, with money. We should manage to get it without
payment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must do so, and I know how,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Mighty-of-his-mouth, and he asked his friend to wait till that
evening.</p>
<p>Now there lived a shepherd at one <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;&rsquo;s</i>
(hour&rsquo;s) distance from their house, and the two friends resolved
to go to his fold that night and steal away one of his goats.
Accordingly, when it was dark, they approached his fold. The shepherd
had just finished his duties to the mute members of his flock, and
wanted to go home and have his rice hot. But he had no second person to
watch the flock, and he must not lose his supper. So he planted his
crook before the fold, and throwing his blanket (<i>kambal&icirc;</i>)
over it, thus addressed it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, I am very hungry, and so must go for my rice. Till I
return do you watch the flock. This wood is rich in tigers and goblins
(<i>bh&ucirc;tas</i>). Some mischievous thief or
<i>bh&ucirc;ta</i>&mdash;or <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e1717" title=
"Source: kuta">k&ucirc;ta</span></i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1719src" href="#xd26e1719" name="xd26e1719src">3</a> may come to
steal away the sheep. Watch over them carefully.&rdquo; So saying the
shepherd went away.</p>
<p>The friends had heard what the shepherd said. Of course, Mr.
Mighty-of-his-mouth laughed within himself at this device of the
shepherd to impress <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95"
name="pb95">95</a>]</span>upon would-be robbers that he had left some
one there to watch his sheep, while really he had only planted a pole
and thrown a blanket over it. Mr. Mighty-of-his-hands, however, did not
see the trick, and mistaking the stick to be an actual watchman sitting
at his duty before the fold, spoke thus to his friend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what are we to do? There is a watchman sitting in front
of the fold.&rdquo; Thereon, Mr. Mighty-of-his-mouth cleared away his
doubts by saying that it was no watchman, but a mere stick, and entered
the fold with his friend.</p>
<p>It had also so happened that on that very night a <i>bh&ucirc;ta</i>
(goblin) had come into the fold to steal away a sheep. It shuddered
with fear on hearing the shepherd mention the <i>k&ucirc;ta</i>, for
having never heard of the existence of <i>k&ucirc;tas</i>, it mistook
this imaginary being to be something superior in strength to itself. So
thinking that a <i>k&ucirc;ta</i> might come to the fold, and not
wishing to expose itself till it knew well what <i>k&ucirc;tas</i>
were, the <i>bh&ucirc;ta</i> transformed itself into a sheep and laid
itself down among the flock. By this time the two Mighties had entered
the fold and begun an examination of the sheep. They went on rejecting
one animal after another for some defect or other, till at last they
came to the sheep which was none other than the <i>bh&ucirc;ta</i>.
They tested it, and when they found it very heavy&mdash;as, of course,
it would be with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>the soul of the <i>bh&ucirc;ta</i> in
it&mdash;they began to tie up its legs to carry it home. When hands
began to shake it the <i>bh&ucirc;ta</i> mistook the Mighties for the
<i>k&ucirc;tas</i>, and said to itself:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! the <i>k&ucirc;tas</i> have come to take me away. What
am I to do? What a fool I was to come into the fold!&rdquo; So thought
the <i>bh&ucirc;ta</i> as Mr. Mighty-of-his-hands was carrying it away
on his head, with his friend following him behind. But the
<i>bh&ucirc;ta</i> soon began to work its devilish powers to extricate
itself, and Mr. Mighty-of-his-hands began to feel pains all over his
body and said to his friend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mighty, I feel pains all over me. I think what we
have brought is no sheep!&rdquo; Mr. Mighty<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1783" title="Not in source">-</span>of-his-mouth was inwardly
alarmed at the words of his friend, but did not like to show that he
was afraid. So he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then put down the sheep, and let us tear open its belly, so
that we shall each have only one-half of it to carry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This frightened the <i>bh&ucirc;ta</i>, and he melted away on the
head of Mr. Mighty-of-his-hands, who, relieved of his devilish burden,
was glad to return home safe with his friend.</p>
<p>The <i>bh&ucirc;ta</i>, too, went to its abode and there told its
fellow-goblins how it had involved itself in a great trouble and how
narrowly it had escaped. They all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97"
href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>laughed at its stupidity and
said, &ldquo;What a great fool you are! They were not
<i>k&ucirc;tas</i>. In fact there are no <i>k&ucirc;tas</i> in the
world. They were men, and it was most stupid of you to have got
yourself into their hands. Are you not ashamed to make such a fuss
about your escape?&rdquo; The injured <i>bh&ucirc;ta</i> retorted that
they would not have made such remarks had they seen the
<i>k&ucirc;tas</i>. &ldquo;Then show us these <i>k&ucirc;tas</i>, as
you choose to call them,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;and we will crush
them in the twinkling of an eye.&rdquo; &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said the
injured <i>bh&ucirc;ta</i>, and the next night it took them to the
house of the Mighties, and said from a distance: &ldquo;There is their
house. I cannot approach it. Do whatever you like.&rdquo; The other
<i>bh&ucirc;tas</i> were amazed at the fear of their timid brother, and
resolved among themselves to put an end to the enemies of even one
member of their caste. So they went in a great crowd to the house of
the Mighties. Some stood outside the house, to see that none of the
inmates escaped, and some watched in the back-yard, while a score of
them jumped over the walls and entered the court-yard.</p>
<p>Mr. Mighty-of-his-hands was sleeping in the verandah, adjoining the
courtyard, and when he heard the noise of people jumping about, he
opened his eyes, and to his terror saw some <i>bh&ucirc;tas</i> in the
court. Without opening his mouth he quietly rolled himself <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>along
the ground, and went to the room where Mr. Mighty-of-his-mouth was
sleeping with his wife and children. Tapping gently at the door he
awoke his friend and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do now? The <i>bh&ucirc;tas</i> have invaded
our house, and will soon kill us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mighty-of-his-mouth told him quietly not to be afraid, but to go
and sleep in his original place, and that he himself would make the
<i>bh&ucirc;tas</i> run away. Mr. Mighty-of-his-hands did not
understand what his friend meant, but not wishing to argue rolled his
way back to his original place and pretended to sleep, though his heart
was beating terribly with fright. Mr. Mighty-of-his-mouth now awoke his
wife, and instructed her thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest wife, the foolish <i>bh&ucirc;tas</i> have invaded
our house, but if you act according to my advice we are safe, and the
goblins will depart harmlessly. What I want you to do is, to go to the
hall and light a lamp, spread leaves on the floor, and then pretend to
awake me for my supper. I shall get up and enquire what you have ready
to give me to eat. You will then reply that you have only pepper water
and vegetables. With an angry face I shall say, &lsquo;What have you
done with the three <i>bh&ucirc;tas</i> that our son caught hold of on
his way back from school?&rsquo; Your reply must be, &lsquo;The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>rogue wanted some sweetmeats on coming home.
Unfortunately I had none in the house, so he roasted the three
<i>bh&ucirc;tas</i> and gobbled them up.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus instructing his wife Mr. Mighty-of-his-mouth pretended to go to
sleep. The wife accordingly spread the leaves and called her husband
for his supper. During the conversation that followed, the fact that
the son had roasted three goblins for sweetmeats was conveyed to the
<i>bh&ucirc;tas</i>. They shuddered at the son&rsquo;s extraordinary
ability, and thought,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What must the father do for his meals when a son roasts three
<i>bh&ucirc;tas</i> for sweetmeats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they at once took to their heels. Then going to the brother they
had jeered at, they said to him that indeed the <i>k&ucirc;tas</i> were
their greatest enemies, and that none of their lives were safe while
they remained where they were, as on that very evening the son of a
<i>k&ucirc;ta</i> had roasted three of them for sweetmeats. They
therefore all resolved to fly away to the adjoining forest, and
disappeared accordingly. Thus Mr. Mighty-of-his-mouth saved himself and
his friend on two occasions from the <i>bh&ucirc;tas</i>.</p>
<p>The friends after this went out one day to an adjoining village and
were returning home rather late in the evening. Darkness fell on them
before half the way was traversed, and there lay before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>them
a dense wood infested by beasts of prey: so they resolved to spend the
night in a high tree and go home next morning, and accordingly got up
into a big <i>p&icirc;pal</i>. Now this was the very wood into which
the <i>bh&ucirc;tas</i> had migrated, and at midnight they all came
down with torches to catch jackals and other animals to feast upon. The
fear of Mr. Mighty-of-his-hands may be more imagined than described.
The dreaded <i>bh&ucirc;tas</i> were at the foot of the very tree in
which he had taken up his abode for the night! His hands trembled. His
body shook. He lost his hold, and down he came with a horrible rustling
of leaves. His friend, however, was, as usual, ready with a device, and
bawled out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wished to leave these poor beings to their own revelry. But
you are hungry and must needs jump down to catch some of them. Do not
fail to lay your hands on the stoutest <i>bh&ucirc;ta</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goblins heard the voice which was already very familiar to their
ears, for was it not the <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e1895" title=
"Source: kuta">k&ucirc;ta</span></i> whose son had roasted up three
<i>bh&ucirc;tas</i> for sweetmeats that spoke? So they ran away at
once, crying out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, what misery! Our bitter enemies have followed us even
to this wood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the wit of Mr. Mighty-of-his-mouth saved himself and his friend
for the third time.</p>
<p>The sun began to rise, and Mr. Mighty-of-his-hands <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>thrice walked round Mr. Mighty-of-his-mouth and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend, truly you only of us two are mighty. Mere
physical strength is of no use without skill in words. The latter is
far superior to the former, and if a man possess both, he is, as it
were, a golden lotus having a sweet scent. It is enough for me now to
have arrived at this moral! With your kind permission I shall return to
my village.&rdquo; Mr. Mighty-of-his-mouth asked his friend not to
consider himself under any obligation, and, after honouring him as
became his position he let him return to his village.</p>
<p>The moral of this short story is that in man there is nothing great
but mind. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=

<h2 class="main">The Mother-in-Law became an Ass.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Little by little the mother-in-law became an
ass&mdash;<i lang="ta-latn">vara vara m&acirc;mi kaludai p&ocirc;l
&acirc;n&acirc;l&#804;</i>, is a proverb among the Tamil&#804;s,
applied to those who day by day go downwards in their progress in
study, position, or life, and based on the following story:&mdash;</p>
<p>In a certain village their lived a Br&acirc;hma&#7751; with his
wife, mother, and mother-in-law. He was a very good man, and equally
kind to all of them. His mother complained of nothing at his hands, but
his wife was a very bad-tempered woman, and always troubled her
mother-in-law by keeping her engaged in this work or that throughout
the day, and giving her very little food in the evening. Owing to this
the poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&rsquo;s mother was almost dying of misery.
On the other hand, her own mother received very kind treatment, of
course, at her daughter&rsquo;s hands, but the husband was so
completely ruled by his wife, that he had no strength of mind to oppose
her ill-treatment of his mother.</p>
<p>One evening, just before sunset, the wife abused <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>her
mother-in-law with such fury, that the latter had to fly away to escape
a thrashing. Full of misery she ran out of the village, but the sun had
begun to set, and the darkness of night was fast overtaking her. So
finding a ruined temple she entered it to pass the night there. It
happened to be the abode of the village K&acirc;l&icirc; (goddess), who
used to come out every night at midnight to inspect her village. That
night she perceived a woman&mdash;the mother of the poor
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&mdash;lurking within her pr&acirc;k&acirc;ras
(boundaries), and being a most benevolent K&acirc;l&icirc;, called out
to her, and asked her what made her so miserable that she should leave
her home on such a dark night. The Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&icirc; told her
story in a few words, and while she was speaking the cunning goddess
was using her supernatural powers to see whether all she said was true
or not, and finding it to be the truth, she thus replied in very
soothing tones:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pity your misery, mother, because your daughter-in-law
troubles and vexes you thus when you have become old, and have no
strength in your body. Now take this mango,&rdquo; and taking a ripe
one from out her waist-band, she gave it to the old
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&icirc; with a smiling face&mdash;&ldquo;eat it, and
you will soon become a young woman like your own daughter-in-law, and
then she shall no longer trouble you.&rdquo; Thus consoling the
afflicted old <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>woman, the kind-hearted K&acirc;l&icirc; went
away. The Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&icirc; lingered for the remainder of the
night in the temple, and being a fond mother she did not like to eat
the whole of the mango without giving a portion of it to her son.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when her son returned home in the evening he found his
mother absent, but his wife explained the matter to him, so as to throw
the blame on the old woman, as she always did. As it was dark he had no
chance of going out to search for her, so he waited for the daylight,
and as soon as he saw the dawn, started to look for his mother. He had
not walked far when to his joy he found her in the temple of
K&acirc;l&icirc;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you pass the cold night, my dearest mother?&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;What did you have for dinner? Wretch that I am to have
got myself married to a cur. Forget all her faults, and return
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother shed tears of joy and sorrow, and related her previous
night&rsquo;s adventure, upon which he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delay not even one <i>nimisha</i> (minute), but eat this
fruit at once. I do <a id="xd26e1945" name="xd26e1945"></a>not want any
of it. Only if you become young and strong enough to stand that nasty
cur&rsquo;s troubles, well and good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the mother ate up the divine fruit, and the son took her upon his
shoulders and brought her home, on reaching which he placed her on the
ground, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>when to his joy she was no longer an old woman,
but a young girl of sixteen, and stronger than his own wife. The
troublesome wife was now totally put down, and was powerless against so
strong a mother-in-law.</p>
<p>She did not at all like the change, and having to give up her habits
of bullying, and so she argued to herself thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This jade of a mother-in-law became young through the fruit
of the K&acirc;l&icirc;, why should not my mother also do the same, if
I instruct her and send her to the same temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she instructed her mother as to the story she ought to give to
the goddess and sent her there. Her old mother, agreeably to her
daughter&rsquo;s injunctions, went to the temple, and on meeting with
the goddess at midnight, gave a false story that she was being greatly
ill-treated by her daughter-in-law, though, in truth, she had nothing
of the kind to complain of. The goddess perceived the lie through her
divine powers, but pretending to pity her, gave her also a fruit. Her
daughter had instructed her not to eat it till next morning, and till
she saw her son-in-law.</p>
<p>As soon as morning approached, the poor hen-pecked
Br&acirc;hma&#7751; was ordered by his wife to go to the temple and
fetch his mother-in-law, as he had some time back fetched away his
mother. He accordingly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href=
"#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>went, and invited her to come
home. She wanted him to eat part of the fruit, as she had been
instructed, but he refused, and so she swallowed it all, fully
expecting to become young again on reaching home. Meanwhile her
son-in-law took her on his shoulders and returned home, expecting, as
his former experience had taught him, to see his mother-in-law also
turn into a young woman. Anxiety to see how the change came on
over-came him, and half<a id="xd26e1962" name="xd26e1962"></a> way he
turned his head, and found such part of the burden on his shoulders as
he could see, to be like parts of an ass, but he took this to be a mere
preliminary stage towards youthful womanhood! Again he turned, and
again he saw the same thing several times, and the more he looked the
more his burden became like an ass, till at last when he reached home,
his burden jumped down braying like an ass and ran away.</p>
<p>Thus the K&acirc;l&icirc;, perceiving the evil intentions of the
wife, disappointed her by turning her mother into an ass, but no one
knew of it till she actually jumped down from the shoulders of her
son-in-law.</p>
<p>This story is always cited as the explanation of the proverb quoted
above&mdash;<i lang="ta-latn">vara vara m&acirc;mi kaludai p&ocirc;l
&acirc;n&acirc;l</i>&mdash;little by little the mother-in-law became an
ass, to which is also commonly added <i lang="ta-latn">&ucirc;r
varumb&ocirc;du &ucirc;laiyida talaippattal</i>&mdash;and as she
approached the village, she began to bray. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a remote village there lived a poor
Br&acirc;hma&#7751; and his wife. Though several years of their wedded
life had passed, they unfortunately had no children, and so, being very
eager for a child, and having no hope of one by his first wife, the
poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751; made up his mind to marry a second. His wife
would not permit it for some time, but finding her husband resolved,
she gave way, thinking within herself that she would manage somehow to
do away with the second wife. As soon as he had got her consent the
Br&acirc;hma&#7751; arranged for his second marriage and wedded a
beautiful Br&acirc;hma&#7751; girl. She went to live with him in the
same house with the first wife, who, thinking that she would be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>making the world suspicious if she did anything
suddenly, waited for some time.</p>
<p>I&#347;vara himself seemed to favour the new marriage, and the
second wife, a year after her wedding, becoming pregnant, went in the
sixth month of her pregnancy to her mother&rsquo;s house for her
confinement. Her husband bore his separation from her patiently for a
fortnight, but after this the desire to see her again began to prey
upon his mind, and he was always asking his first wife when he ought to
go to her. She seemed to sympathise fully with his trouble, and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest husband, your health is daily being injured, and I
am glad that your love for her has not made it worse than it is.
To-morrow you must start on a visit to her. It is said that we should
not go empty-handed to children, a king, or a pregnant woman; so I
shall give you one hundred <i>ap&ucirc;pa</i> cakes, packed up
separately in a vessel, which you must give to her. You are very fond
of <i>ap&ucirc;pas</i> and I fear that you will eat some of them on the
way; but you had better not do so. And I will give you some cakes
packed in a cloth separately for you to eat on your journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the first wife spent the whole night in preparing the
<i>ap&ucirc;pa</i> cakes, and mixed poison in the sugar and rice-flour
of those she made for her co-wife and rival; but as she entertained no
enmity against her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"
name="pb109">109</a>]</span>husband the <i>ap&ucirc;pas</i> cakes for
him were properly prepared. By the time the morning dawned she had
packed up the hundred <i>ap&ucirc;pas</i> in a brass vessel which could
be easily carried on a man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>After a light breakfast&mdash;for a heavy one is always bad before a
journey on foot&mdash;the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; placed the brass vessel
on his head, and holding in his hand the kerchief containing the food
for himself on the way, started for the village of his second wife,
which happened to be at a distance of two days&rsquo; journey. He
walked in hot haste till evening approached, and when the darkness of
night overtook him the rapidity of his walk had exhausted him, and he
felt very hungry. He espied a wayside shed and a tank near his path,
and entered the water to perform his evening ablution to the god of the
day, who was fast going down below the horizon. As soon as this was
over he untied his kerchief, and did full justice to its contents by
swallowing every cake whole. He then drank some water, and being quite
overcome by fatigue, fell into a deep slumber in the shed, with his
brass vessel and its sweet, or rather poisonous, contents under his
head.</p>
<p>Close by the spot where the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; slept there reigned
a famous king who had a very beautiful daughter. Several persons
demanded her hand in marriage, among whom was a robber chieftain who
wanted her for his only son. Though the king liked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>the
boy for his beauty, the thought that he was only a robber for all that
prevented him from making up his mind to give his daughter in marriage
to him. The robber chief, however, was determined to have his own way,
and accordingly despatched one hundred of his band to fetch away the
princess in the night without her knowledge while she was sleeping, to
his palace in the woods. In obedience to their chieftain&rsquo;s order
the robbers, on the night the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; happened to sleep in
the shed, entered the king&rsquo;s palace and stole away the princess,
together with the bed on which she was sleeping. On reaching the shed
the hundred robbers found themselves very thirsty&mdash;for being awake
at midnight always brings on thirst. So they placed the cot on the
ground and were entering the water to quench their thirst; just then
they smelt the <i>ap&ucirc;pa</i> cakes, which, for all that they
contained poison, had a very sweet savour. The robbers searched about
the shed, and found the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; sleeping on one side and
the brass vessel lying at a distance from him, for he had pushed it
from underneath his head when he had stretched himself in his sleep;
they opened the vessel, and to their joy found in it exactly one
hundred <i>ap&ucirc;pa</i> cakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have one here for each of us, and that is something better
than mere water. Let us each eat before we go into it,&rdquo; said the
leader of the gang, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111"
name="pb111">111</a>]</span>and at once each man swallowed greedily
what he had in his hand, and immediately all fell down dead. Lucky it
was that no one knew of the old Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&icirc;&rsquo;s
trick. Had the robbers had any reason to suspect it they would never
have eaten the cakes; had the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; known it he would
never have brought them with him for his dear second wife. Lucky was it
for the poor old Br&acirc;hma&#7751; and his second wife, and lucky was
it for the sleeping princess, that these cakes went, after all, into
the stomachs of the villainous robbers!</p>
<p>After sleeping his fill the Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, who had been
dreaming of his second wife all night, awoke in haste to pursue the
remainder of his journey to her house. He could not find his brass
vessel, but near the place where he had left it he found several men of
the woods, whom he knew very well by their appearance to be robbers, as
he thought, sleeping. Angered at the loss of his vessel he took up a
sword from one of the dead robbers and cut off all their heads,
thinking all the while that he was killing one hundred living robbers,
who were sleeping after having eaten all his cakes. Presently the
princess&rsquo;s cot fell under his gaze, and he approached it and
found on it a most beautiful lady fast asleep. Being an intelligent man
he perceived that the persons whose heads he had cut off must have been
some thieves, or other wicked men, who had carried her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>off.
He was not long in doubt, for not far off he saw an army marching up
rapidly with a king at its head, who was saying, &ldquo;Down with the
robber who has stolen away my daughter.&rdquo; The Br&acirc;hma&#7751;
at once inferred that this must be the father of the sleeping princess,
and suddenly waking her up from her sleep spoke thus to her:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold before you the hundred robbers that brought you here a
few hours ago from your palace. I fought one and all of them
single-handed, and have killed them all.<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2052" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>The princess was highly pleased at what she heard, for she knew of
all the tricks the robbers had previously played to carry her off. So
she fell reverently at the Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&rsquo;s feet and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend, never till now have I heard of a warrior who,
single-handed, fought one hundred robbers<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2059" title="Source: ,">.</span> Your valour is unparalleled. I
<i>will</i> be your wife, if only in remembrance of your having saved
me from falling into the hands of these ruffians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father and his army was now near the shed, for he had all along
watched the conduct of the robber chieftain, and as soon as the
maid-servants of the palace informed him of the disappearance of the
princess and her bed, he marched straight with his soldiers for the
woods. His joy, when he saw his daughter safe, knew no bounds, and he
flew into his daughter&rsquo;s arms, while she pointed to the
Br&acirc;hma&#7751; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113"
name="pb113">113</a>]</span>as her preserver. The king now put a
thousand questions to our hero, who, being well versed in matters of
fighting, gave sound replies, and so came successfully out of his first
adventure. The king, astonished at his valour, took him to his palace,
and rewarded him with the hand of the princess. And the robber
chieftain, fearing the new son-in-law, who, single-handed, had killed a
hundred of his robbers, never troubled himself about the princess. Thus
the Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&rsquo;s first adventure ended in making him
son-in-law to a king!</p>
<p>Now there lived a lioness in a wood near the princess&rsquo;s
country, who had a great taste for human flesh, and so, once a week,
the king used to send a man into the wood to serve as her prey. All the
people now collected together before the king, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most honoured king, while you have a son-in-law who killed
one hundred robbers with his sword, why should you continue to send a
man into the wood every week. We request you to send your son-in-law
next week to the wood and have the lioness killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed most reasonable to the king, who called for his
son-in-law, and sent him, armed to the teeth, into the wood.</p>
<p>Now our Br&acirc;hma&#7751; could not refuse to go, for fear of
losing the fame of his former exploit, and, hoping that fortune would
favour him, he asked his father-in-law <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>to have him hoisted
up into a big banyan tree with all kinds of weapons, and this was done.
The appointed time for the lioness to eat her prey approached, and as
she saw no one coming for her, and as sometimes those that had to come
used to linger for a short time in the tree in which the
Br&acirc;hma&#7751; had taken refuge, she went up to it to see that no
such trick has been played upon her this time. This made the
Br&acirc;hma&#7751; tremble so violently that he dropped the sword he
held in his hand. At that very moment the lioness happened to yawn, and
the sword dropped right into her jaws and killed her. As soon as the
Br&acirc;hma&#7751; saw the course which events had taken, he came down
from the tree, and invented a thousand stories of how he had given
battle to the terrible lioness and overcome her. This exploit fully
established his valour, and feasts and rejoicings in honour of it
followed, and the whole country round blessed the son-in-law of their
king.</p>
<p>Near this kingdom there also reigned a powerful emperor, who levied
tribute from all the surrounding countries. To this emperor the
father-in-law of our most valorous Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, who, at one
stroke, had killed one hundred robbers, and, at another, a fierce
lioness, had also to pay a certain amount of tribute; but, trusting to
the power of his son-in-law, he stopped the tribute to the emperor,
who, by the way, was named Appayya R&acirc;ja, and who, as soon as the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>tribute was stopped, invaded his dominions, and
his father-in-law besought the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; for assistance.</p>
<p>Again the poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751; could not refuse, for, if he did,
all his former fame would have been lost; so he determined to undertake
this adventure also, and to trust to fortune rather than give up the
attempt. He asked for the best horse and the sharpest sword, and set
out to fight the enemy, who had already encamped on the other side of
the river, which flowed at a short distance to the east of the
town.</p>
<p>Now the king had a very unruly horse, which had never been broken
in, and this he gave his son-in-law; and, supplying him with a sharp
sword, asked him to start. The Br&acirc;hma&#7751; then asked the
king&rsquo;s servants to tie him up with cotton strings tight on to the
saddle, and set out on the expedition.</p>
<p>The horse, having never till then felt a man on its back, began to
gallop most furiously, and flew onwards so fast that all who saw it
thought the rider must lose his life, and he too was almost dead with
fear. He tried his best to curb his steed, but the more he pulled the
faster it galloped, till giving up all hopes of life he let it take its
course. It jumped into the water and swam across to the other side of
the river, wetting the cotton cords by which the Br&acirc;hma&#7751;
was tied down to the saddle, making them swell and giving him the most
excruciating pain. He bore it, however, with all the patience
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>imaginable. Presently the horse reached the
other side of the river, where there was a big palmyra tree, which a
recent flood had left almost uprooted and ready to fall at the
slightest touch. The Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, unable to stop the course of
the horse, held fast on to the tree, hoping thus to check its wild
career. But unfortunately for him the tree gave way, and the steed
galloped on so furiously that he did not know which was the
safer&mdash;to leave the tree or to hold on to it. Meanwhile the wet
cotton cords hurt him so that he, in the hopelessness of despair,
bawled out <i>appa</i>! <i>ayya</i>!<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2098src" href="#xd26e2098" name="xd26e2098src">2</a> On went his
steed, and still he held on to the palmyra tree. Though now fighting
for his own life, the people that were watching him from a great
distance thought him to be flying to the battlefield, armed with a
palmyra tree! The cry of lamentation, <i>appa ayya</i>, which he
uttered, his enemy mistook for a challenge, because, as we know, his
name happened to be Appayya. Horror-struck at the sight of a warrior
armed with a huge tree, his enemy turned and fled. <i>Yath&acirc;
r&acirc;j&acirc; tath&acirc; praj&acirc;h</i>&mdash;&ldquo;As is the
king so are the subjects,&rdquo;&mdash;and accordingly his followers
also fled. The Br&acirc;hma&#7751; warrior (!) seeing the fortunate
course events had again taken pursued <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>the enemy, or rather
let his courser have its own furious way. Thus the enemy and his vast
army melted away in the twinkling of an eye, and the horse, too, when
it became exhausted, returned towards the palace.</p>
<p>The old king had been watching from the loftiest rooms of his palace
all that had passed on the other side of the river, and believing his
son-in-law had, by his own prowess, driven out the enemy, approached
him with all pomp. Eager hands quickly cut the knots by which the
victorious (!) Br&acirc;hma&#7751; had been held tight in his saddle,
and his old father-in-law with tears of joy embraced him on his
victory, saying that the whole kingdom was indebted to him. A splendid
triumphal march was conducted, in which the eyes of the whole town were
directed towards our victorious hero.</p>
<p>Thus, on three different occasions, and in three different
adventures, fortune favoured the poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751; and brought
him fame. He then sent for his two former wives and took them into his
palace. His second wife, who was pregnant when he first started with
the <i>ap&ucirc;pa</i> cakes to see her, had given birth to a male
child, who was, when she came back to him, more than a year old. The
first wife confessed to her husband her sin of having given him
poisoned cakes, and craved his pardon; and it was only now that he came
to know that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118"
name="pb118">118</a>]</span>hundred robbers he killed in his first
adventure were all really dead men, and that they must have died from
the effects of the poison in the cakes, and, since her treachery had
given him a new start in life, he forgave her. She, too, gave up her
enmity to the partners of her husband&rsquo;s bed, and all the four
lived in peace and plenty for many a long day afterwards. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; Girl that Married a
Tiger.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain village there lived an old
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; who had three sons and a daughter. The girl being
the youngest was brought up most tenderly and became spoilt, and so
whenever she saw a beautiful boy she would say to her parents that she
must be wedded to him. Her parents were, therefore, much put about to
devise excuses for taking her away from her youthful lovers. Thus
passed on some years, till the girl was very nearly grown up, and then
the parents, fearing that they would be driven out of their caste if
they failed to dispose of her hand in marriage before she came to the
years of maturity, began to be eager about finding a bridegroom for
her.</p>
<p>Now near their village there lived a fierce tiger, that had attained
to great proficiency in the art of magic, and had the power of assuming
different forms. Having a great taste for Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;&rsquo;s
food, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>the tiger used now and then to frequent temples
and other places of public refreshment in the shape of an old famished
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; in order to share the food prepared for the
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;s. The tiger also wanted, if possible, a
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; wife to take to the woods, and there to make her
cook his meals after her fashion. One day, when he was partaking of his
meals in Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; shape at a <i>satra</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2133src" href="#xd26e2133" name="xd26e2133src">1</a>, he heard
the talk about the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; girl who was always falling in
love with every beautiful Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; boy.</p>
<p>Said he to himself, &ldquo;Praised be the face that I saw first this
morning. I shall assume the shape of a Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; boy, and
appear as beautiful can be, and win the heart of the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning he accordingly became in the form of a great
&#346;&acirc;strin (proficient in the
<i>R&acirc;m&acirc;ya&#7751;a</i>) and took his seat near the
<i>gh&acirc;&#7789;</i> of the sacred river of the village. Scattering
holy ashes profusely over his body he opened the
<i>R&acirc;m&acirc;ya&#7751;a</i> and began to read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The voice of the new &#346;&acirc;strin is most enchanting.
Let us go and hear him,&rdquo; said some women among themselves, and
sat down before him to hear him expound the great book. The girl for
whom the tiger had assumed this shape came in due time to bathe at the
river, and as soon as she saw the new &#346;&acirc;strin fell in love
with him, and bothered her old <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"
href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>mother to speak to her father
about him, so as not to lose her new lover. The old woman too was
delighted at the bridegroom whom fortune had thrown in her way, and ran
home to her husband, who, when he came and saw the &#346;&acirc;strin,
raised up his hands in praise of the great god Mah&ecirc;&#347;vara.
The &#346;&acirc;strin was now invited to take his meals with them, and
as he had come with the express intention of marrying the daughter, he,
of course, agreed.</p>
<p>A grand dinner followed in honour of the &#346;&acirc;strin, and his
host began to question him as to his parentage, &amp;c., to which the
cunning tiger replied that he was born in a village beyond the adjacent
wood. The Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; had no time to wait for further
enquiries, and as the boy was very fair he married his daughter to him
the very next day. Feasts followed for a month, during which time the
bridegroom gave every satisfaction to his new relatives, who supposed
him to be human all the while. He also did full justice to the
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; dishes, and swallowed everything that was placed
before him.</p>
<p>After the first month was over the tiger-bridegroom bethought him of
his accustomed prey, and hankered after his abode in the woods. A
change of diet for a day or two is all very well, but to renounce his
own proper food for more than a month was hard. So one day he said to
his father-in-law, &ldquo;I must go back soon to my old parents, for
they will be pining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122"
name="pb122">122</a>]</span>at my absence. But why should we have to
bear the double expense of my coming all the way here again to take my
wife to my village? So if you will kindly let me take the girl with me
I shall take her to her future home, and hand her over to her
mother-in-law, and see that she is well taken care of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; agreed to this, and replied, &ldquo;My
dear son-in-law, you are her husband, and she is yours, and we now send
her with you, though it is like sending her into the wilderness with
her eyes tied up. But as we take you to be everything to her, we trust
you to treat her kindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother of the bride shed tears at the idea of having to send her
away, but nevertheless the very next day was fixed for the journey. The
old woman spent the whole day in preparing cakes and sweetmeats for her
daughter, and when the time for the journey arrived, she took care to
place in her bundles and on her head one or two margosa<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2163src" href="#xd26e2163" name="xd26e2163src">2</a>
leaves to keep off demons. The relatives of the bride requested her
husband to allow her to rest wherever she found shade, and to eat
wherever she found water, and to this he agreed, and so they began
their journey.</p>
<p>The boy tiger and his human wife pursued their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>journey for two or three
<i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2173src" href=
"#xd26e2173" name="xd26e2173src">3</a> in free and pleasant
conversation, when the girl happened to see a fine pond, round which
the birds were warbling their sweet notes. She requested her husband to
follow her to the water&rsquo;s edge and to partake of some of the
cakes and sweetmeats with her.</p>
<p>But he replied, &ldquo;Be quiet, or I shall show you my original
shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This made her afraid, so she pursued her journey in silence until
she saw another pond, when she asked the same question of her husband,
who replied in the same tone.</p>
<p>Now she was very hungry, and not liking her husband&rsquo;s tone,
which she found had greatly changed ever since they had entered the
woods, said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me your original shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner were these words uttered than her husband&rsquo;s form
changed from that of a man. Four legs, striped skin, a long tail, and a
tiger&rsquo;s face came over him suddenly and, horror of horrors! a
tiger and not a man stood before her! Nor were her fears stilled when
the tiger in human voice began as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know henceforth that I, your husband, am a tiger&mdash;this
very tiger that now speaks to you. If you have any regard for your life
you must obey all my orders implicitly, for I can speak to you in human
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>voice, and understand what you say. In a couple
of <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</i> we shall reach my home, of which you
will become the mistress. In the front of my house you will see
half-a-dozen tubs, each of which you must fill up daily with some dish
or other, cooked in your own way. I shall take care to supply you with
all the provisions you want.&rdquo; So saying the tiger slowly
conducted her to his house.</p>
<p>The misery of the girl may more be imagined than described, for if
she were to object she would be put to death. So, weeping all the way,
she reached her husband&rsquo;s house. Leaving her there he went out
and <span class="corr" id="xd26e2199" title=
"Source: retured">returned</span> with several pumpkins and some flesh,
of which she soon prepared a curry and gave it to her husband. He went
out again after this and returned in the evening with several
vegetables and some more flesh, and gave her an order:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every morning I shall go out in search of provisions and
prey, and bring something with me on my return; you must keep cooked
for me whatever I leave in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So next morning as soon as the tiger had gone away she cooked
everything left in the house and filled all the tubs with food. At the
tenth <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</i> the tiger returned and growled
out,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smell a man! I smell a woman in my wood.&rdquo; And his
wife for very fear shut herself up in the house.</p>
<p>As soon as the tiger had satisfied his appetite he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>told
her to open the door, which she did, and they talked together for a
time, after which the tiger rested awhile, and then went out hunting
again. Thus passed many a day, till the tiger&rsquo;s
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; wife had a son, which also turned out to be only a
tiger.</p>
<p>One day, after the tiger had gone out to the woods, his wife was
crying all alone in the house, when a crow happened to peck at some
rice that was scattered near her, and seeing the girl crying, began to
shed tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you assist me?&rdquo; asked the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the crow.</p>
<p>So she brought out a palmyra leaf and wrote on it with an iron nail
all her sufferings in the wood, and requested her brothers to come and
relieve her. This palmyra leaf she tied to the neck of the crow, which,
seeming to understand her thoughts, flew to her village and sat down
before one of her brothers. He untied the leaf and read the contents of
the letter and told them to his other brothers. All the three then
started for the wood, asking their mother to give them something to eat
on the way. She had not enough rice for the three, so she made a big
ball of clay and stuck it over with what rice she had, so as to make it
look like a ball of rice. This she gave to the brothers to eat on their
way, and started them off to the woods. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>They had not proceeded long before they espied an ass. The youngest,
who was of a playful disposition, wished to take the ass with him. The
two elder brothers objected to this for a time, but in the end they
allowed him to have his own way. Further on they saw an ant, which the
middle brother took with him. Near the ant there was a big palmyra tree
lying on the ground, which the eldest took with him to keep off the
tiger.</p>
<p>The sun was now high in the horizon and the three brothers became
very hungry. So they sat down near a tank and opened the bundle
containing the ball of rice. To their utter disappointment they found
it to be all clay, but being extremely hungry they drank all the water
in the pond and continued their journey. On leaving the tank they found
a big iron tub belonging to the washerman of the adjacent village. This
they took also with them in addition to the ass, the ant, and the
palmyra tree. Following the road described by their sister in her
letter sent by the crow, they walked on and on till they reached the
tiger&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>The sister, overjoyed to see her brothers again, ran out at once to
welcome them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest brothers, I am so glad to see that you have come
here to relieve me after all, but the time for the tiger&rsquo;s coming
home is approaching, so hide yourselves in the loft, and wait till he
is gone.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127"
name="pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>So saying, she helped her brothers to ascend into the loft. By this
time the tiger returned, and perceived the presence of human beings by
the peculiar smell. He asked his wife whether any one had come to their
house. She said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; But when the brothers, who with
their trophies of the way&mdash;the ass, the ant, and so on&mdash;were
sitting upon the loft, saw the tiger dallying with their sister, they
were greatly frightened; so much so that the youngest, through fear,
began to quake, and they all fell on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; said the terrified tiger to his
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but your brothers-in-law.
They came here a watch<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2241src" href=
"#xd26e2241" name="xd26e2241src">4</a> ago, and as soon as you have
finished your meals they want to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can my brothers-in-law be such cowards,&rdquo; thought
the tiger to himself.</p>
<p>He then asked them to speak to him, whereon the youngest brother put
the ant which he had in his hand into the ear of the ass, and as soon
as the latter was bitten, it began to bawl out most horribly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it that your brothers have such a hoarse voice?&rdquo;
said the tiger to his wife.</p>
<p>He next asked them to show him their legs. Taking courage at the
stupidity of the tiger on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href=
"#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>the two former occasions, the
eldest brother now stretched out the palmyra tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my father, I have never seen such a leg,&rdquo; said the
tiger, and asked his brothers-in-law to show their bellies. The second
brother now showed the tub, at which the tiger shuddered, and saying,
&ldquo;such a harsh voice, so stout a leg, and such a belly, truly I
have never heard of such persons as these!&rdquo; He ran away.</p>
<p>It was already dark, and the brothers, wishing to take advantage of
the tiger&rsquo;s terror, prepared to return home with their sister at
once. They ate up what little food she had, and ordered her to start.
Fortunately for her her tiger-child was asleep. So she tore it into two
pieces and suspended them over the hearth, and, thus getting rid of the
child, she ran off with her brothers towards home.</p>
<p>Before leaving she bolted the front door from inside, and went out
at the back of the house. As soon as the pieces of the cub, which were
hung up over the hearth, began to roast, they dripped, which made the
fire hiss and sputter; and when the tiger returned at about midnight,
he found the door shut and heard the hissing of the fire, which he
mistook for the noise of cooking muffins.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2263src" href="#xd26e2263" name="xd26e2263src">5</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;how very cunning
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>you are; you have bolted the door and are
cooking muffins for your brothers. Let us see if we can&rsquo;t get
your muffins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he went round to the back door and entered his house, and
was greatly perplexed to find his cub torn in two and being roasted,
his house deserted by his Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; wife, and his property
plundered; for his wife, before leaving, had taken with her as much of
the tiger&rsquo;s property as she could conveniently carry.</p>
<p>The tiger now discovered all the treachery of his wife, and his
heart grieved for the loss of his son, that was now no more. He
determined to be revenged on his wife, and to bring her back into the
wood, and there tear her into many pieces in place of only two. But how
to bring her back? He assumed his original shape of a young bridegroom,
making, of course, due allowance for the number of years that had
passed since his marriage, and next morning went to his
father-in-law&rsquo;s house. His brothers-in-law and his wife saw from
a distance the deceitful form he had assumed, and devised means to kill
him. Meanwhile the tiger Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; approached his
father-in-law&rsquo;s house, and the old people welcomed him. The
younger ones too ran here and there to bring provisions to feed him
sumptuously, and the tiger was highly pleased at the hospitable way in
which he was received. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>There was a ruined well at the back of the house, and the eldest of
the brothers placed some thin sticks across its mouth, over which he
spread a fine mat. Now it is usual to ask guests to have an oil bath
before dinner, and so his three brothers-in-law requested the tiger to
take his seat on the fine mat for his bath. As soon as he sat on it,
the thin sticks being unable to bear his weight, gave way, and down
fell the cunning tiger with a heavy crash! The well was at once filled
in with stones and other rubbish, and thus the tiger was effectually
prevented from doing any more mischief.</p>
<p>But the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; girl, in memory of her having married a
tiger, raised a pillar over the well and planted a
<i>tula&#347;i</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2285src" href=
"#xd26e2285" name="xd26e2285src">6</a> shrub on the top of it. Morning
and evening, for the rest of her life, she used to smear the pillar
with sacred cowdung, and water the <i>tula&#347;i</i> shrub.</p>
<p>This story is told to explain the Tamil proverb, &ldquo;<i lang=
"ta-latn">&#346;umm&acirc; irukkiraya, &#347;uruvattai
k&acirc;&#7789;&#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;uma</i>,&rdquo; which
means&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, or I shall show you my original shape.&rdquo;

<h2 class="main">The Good Husband and the Bad Wife.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a remote village there lived a Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;
whose good nature and charitable disposition were proverbial. Equally
proverbial also were the ill-nature and uncharitable disposition of the
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&icirc;&mdash;his wife. But as
Param&ecirc;&#347;vara (God) had joined them in matrimony, they had to
live together as husband and wife, though their temperaments were so
incompatible. Every day the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; had a taste of his
wife&rsquo;s ill-temper, and if any other Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; was
invited to dinner by him, his wife, somehow or other, would manage to
drive him away.</p>
<p>One fine summer morning a rather stupid Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; friend
of his came to visit our hero and was at once invited to dinner. He
told his wife to have dinner ready earlier than usual, and went off to
the river to bathe. His friend not feeling very well that day wanted a
hot bath at the house, and so did not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>follow him to the
river, but remained sitting in the outer verandah. If any other guest
had come, the wife would have accused him of greediness to his face and
sent him away, but this visitor seemed to be a special friend of her
lord, so she did not like to say anything; but she devised a plan to
make him go away of his own accord.</p>
<p>She proceeded to smear the ground before her husband&rsquo;s friend
with cowdung, and placed in the midst of it a long pestle, supporting
one end of it against the wall. She next approached the pestle most
solemnly and performed worship (<i>p&ucirc;j&acirc;</i>) to it. The
guest did not in the least understand what she was doing, and
respectfully asked her what it all meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what is called pestle worship,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;I do it as a daily duty, and this pestle is intended to break
the head of some human being in honour of a goddess, whose feet are
most devoutly worshipped by my husband. Every day as soon as he returns
from his bath in the river, he takes this pestle, which I am ordered to
keep ready for him before his return, and with it breaks the head of
any human being whom he has managed to get hold of by inviting him to a
meal. This is his tribute (<i>dakshi&#7751;&acirc;</i>) to the goddess;
to-day you are the victim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guest was much alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! break the head of a guest! I at any <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>rate
shall not be deceived to-day,&rdquo; thought he, and prepared to run
away.</p>
<p>The Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;&rsquo;s wife appeared to sympathise with his
sad plight, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I do pity you. But there is one thing you can do now
to save yourself. If you go out by the front door and walk down the
street my husband may follow you, so you had better go out by the back
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this plan the guest most thankfully agreed, and hastily ran off
by the back door.</p>
<p>Almost immediately our hero returned from his bath, but before he
could arrive his wife had cleaned up the place she had prepared for the
pestle worship, and when the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, not finding his
friend in the house inquired of her as to what had become of him, she
said in seeming anger:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greedy brute! he wanted me to give him this
pestle&mdash;this very pestle which I brought forty years ago as a
dowry from my mother&rsquo;s house, and when I refused he ran away by
the back-yard in haste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her kind-hearted lord observed that he would rather lose the
pestle than his guest, even though it was a part of his wife&rsquo;s
dowry, and more than forty years old. So he ran off with the pestle in
his hand after his friend, crying out,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;! Oh Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;! Stop please,
and take the pestle.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the story told by the old woman now seemed all the more true to
the guest when he saw her husband running after him, and so he
said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your pestle may go where you please. Never more will
you catch me in your house,&rdquo; and ran away. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a remote village there lived a man and his wife,
who was a stupid little woman and believed everything that was told
her. Whenever people wanted anything from her they used to come and
flatter her; but this had to be done in the absence of her husband,
because he was a very miserly man, and would never part with any of his
money, for all he was exceedingly rich. Nevertheless, without his
knowledge cunning beggars would now and then come to his wife and beg
of her, and they used generally to succeed, as she was so amenable to
flattery. But whenever her husband found her out he would come down
heavily upon her, sometimes with words and sometimes with blows. Thus
quarrels arose, till at last, for the sake of peace, the wife had to
give up her charitable propensities.</p>
<p>Now there lived in the village a rogue of the first <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>water, who had many a time witnessed what took
place in the rich miser&rsquo;s family. Wishing to revive his old habit
of getting what he wanted from the miser&rsquo;s wife he watched his
opportunity and one day, when the miser had gone out on horseback to
inspect his land, he came to his wife in the middle of the day and fell
down at the threshold as if overcome by exhaustion. She ran up to him
at once and asked him who he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a native of Kail&acirc;sa<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2391" title="Source: &rdquo;,">,&rdquo;</span> said he,
&ldquo;sent down by an old couple living there, for news of their son
and his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are those fortunate dwellers on <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2396" title="Source: Siva&rsquo;s">&#346;iva&rsquo;s</span>
mountain?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>On this the rogue gave the names of her husband&rsquo;s deceased
parents, which he had taken good care, of course, to learn from the
neighbours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really come from them?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Are
they doing well there? Dear old people. How glad my husband would be to
see you, were he here! Sit down please, and take rest awhile till he
returns. How do they live there? Have they enough to eat and to dress
themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These and a thousand other questions she put to the rogue, who, for
his part, wanted to get away as quick as possible, as he knew full well
how he would be treated if the miser should return while he was there,
so he said:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137"
name="pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, language has no words to describe the miseries they
are undergoing in the other world. They have not a rag to cover
themselves, and for the last six days they have eaten nothing, and have
lived on water only. It would break your heart to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rogue&rsquo;s pathetic words fully deceived the good woman, who
firmly believed that he had come down from Kail&acirc;sa, sent by the
old couple to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should they suffer so?&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;when their
son has plenty to eat and to dress himself, and when their
daughter-in-law wears all sorts of costly ornaments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she went into the house and came out with two boxes
containing all the clothes of herself and her husband, and gave the
whole lot to the rogue, with instructions to take them to her poor old
people in Kail&acirc;sa. She also gave him her jewel box for her
mother-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But dress and jewels will not fill their hungry
stomachs,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Requesting him to wait a little, the silly woman brought out her
husband&rsquo;s cash chest and emptied the contents into the
rogue&rsquo;s coat,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2419src" href=
"#xd26e2419" name="xd26e2419src">2</a> who now went off in haste,
promising to give everything to the good people in Kail&acirc;sa. Our
good lady in accordance with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href=
"#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>etiquette, conducted him a few
hundred yards along the road and sent news of herself through him to
her relatives, and then returned home. The rogue now tied up all his
booty in his coat and ran in haste towards the river and crossed over
it.</p>
<p>No sooner had our heroine reached home than her husband returned
after his inspection of his lands. Her pleasure at what she had done
was so great, that she met him at the door and told him all about the
arrival of the messenger from Kail&acirc;sa, and how she had sent
clothes, and jewels, and money through him to her husband&rsquo;s
parents. The anger of her husband knew no bounds. But he checked
himself for a while, and asked her which road the messenger from
Kail&acirc;sa had taken, as he said he wanted to follow him and send
some more news to his parents. To this she willingly agreed and pointed
out the direction the rogue had gone. With rage in his heart at the
trick played upon his stupid wife, our hero rode on in hot haste, and
after a ride of two <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</i> he caught sight of the
departing rogue, who, finding escape hopeless, climbed up into a big
<i>p&icirc;pal</i> tree. Our hero soon reached the bottom of the tree
and shouted to the rogue to come down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot, this is the way to Kail&acirc;sa,&rdquo; said
the rogue, and climbed up on the top of the tree.</p>
<p>Seeing no chance of the rogue&rsquo;s coming down, and as there was
no third person present to whom he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139"
href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>could call for help, our hero
tied his horse to an adjacent tree and began climbing up the
<i>p&icirc;pal</i> tree himself. The rogue thanked all his gods when he
saw this, and waited till his enemy had climbed nearly up to him, and
then, throwing down his bundle of booty, leapt quickly from branch to
branch till he reached the bottom. He then got upon his enemy&rsquo;s
horse, and with his bundle rode into a dense forest in which no one was
likely to find him.</p>
<p>Our hero being much older in years was no match for the rogue. So he
slowly came down, and cursing his stupidity in having risked his horse
to recover his property, returned home at his leisure. His wife, who
was waiting his arrival, welcomed him with a cheerful countenance and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much, you have sent away your horse to
Kail&acirc;sa to be used by your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vexed as he was at his wife&rsquo;s words, our hero replied in the
affirmative to conceal his own stupidity.</p>
<p>Thus, some there are in this world, who, though they may not
willingly give away anything, pretend to have done so when, by
accident, or stupidity, they happen to lose it. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a city called Alakapuri, famous for all the
riches that sea and land can yield, and inhabited by people speaking
different languages. In that city reigned a king named Alakesa, who was
a storehouse of all excellent qualities. He was so just a king that
during his reign the cow and the tiger amicably quenched their thirst
side by side in the same pond, the cats and the rats sported in one and
the same spot, and the kite and the parrot laid their eggs in the same
nest, as though they were &ldquo;birds of a feather.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2467src" href="#xd26e2467" name="xd26e2467src">1</a>
The women never deviated from the path of virtue, and regarded their
husbands as gods. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141"
name="pb141">141</a>]</span>Timely rain refreshed the soil, and all
Alakesa&rsquo;s subjects lived in plenty and happiness. In short,
Alakesa was the body, and his subjects the soul of that body, for he
was upright in all things.</p>
<p>Now there was in Alakapuri a rich merchant who lost a camel one day.
He searched for it without success in all directions, and at last
reached a road which he was informed led to another city, called
Mathurapuri, the king of which was named Mathuresa. He had under him
four excellent ministers, whose names were Bodhaditya, Bodhachandra,
Bodhavyapaka, and Bodhavibhishana. These four ministers, being, for
some reason, displeased with the king, quitted his dominions, and set
out for another country. As they journeyed along they observed the
track of a camel, and each made a remark on the peculiar condition of
the animal, judging from the footsteps and other indications on the
road.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2476src" href="#xd26e2476" name=
"xd26e2476src">2</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>Presently they met the merchant who was searching for his camel,
and, entering into conversation with him, one of the travellers
inquired if the animal was not lame in one of its legs; another asked
if it was not blind of the right eye; the third asked if its tail was
not unusually short; and the fourth inquired if it was not suffering
from colic. They were all answered in the affirmative by the merchant,
who was convinced that they must have seen the animal, and eagerly
demanded where they had seen it. They replied that they had seen traces
of the camel, but not the camel itself, which being inconsistent with
the minute description they had given of it, the merchant accused them
of having stolen the beast, and immediately applied to king Alakesa for
redress.</p>
<p>On hearing the merchant&rsquo;s story, the king was equally
impressed with the belief that the travellers must know what had become
of the camel, and sending for them threatened them with his displeasure
if they did not confess the truth. How could they know, he demanded,
that the camel was lame or blind, or whether the tail was long or
short, or that it was suffering from any malady, unless they had it in
their possession? In reply, they each explained the reasons which had
induced them to express their belief in these particulars. The first
traveller said:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=
"#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed in the footmarks of the animal that one was
deficient, and I concluded accordingly that it was lame of one of its
legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second said:&mdash;&ldquo;I noticed that the leaves of the trees
on the left side of the road had been snapped or torn off, whilst those
on the right side were untouched, whence I concluded that the animal
was blind of his right eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third said:&mdash;&ldquo;I saw some drops of blood on the road,
which I conjectured had flowed from the bites of gnats or flies, and I
thence concluded that the camel&rsquo;s tail was shorter than usual, in
consequence of which he could not brush the insects away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fourth said:&mdash;&ldquo;I observed that while the forefeet of
the animal were planted firmly on the ground the hind ones appeared to
have scarcely touched it, whence I guessed that they were contracted by
pain in the belly of the animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard their explanation he was much struck by the
sagacity of the travellers, and giving 500 pagodas to the merchant who
had lost the camel; he made the four young men his principal ministers,
and bestowed on each of them several villages as free gifts.

<h3 class="main">The Three Calamities.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From that time these four <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2506" title="Source: youug">young</span> men became the
confidential advisers of king Alakesa in all important affairs of
state, and, as night is the house of sins, they in turn kept a regular
watch in the city of Alakapuri, each patrolling the streets during
three hours of the night. Thus they continued to faithfully serve king
Alakesa, till one night, the First Minister, when his watch was over,
proceeded as usual, to see whether the royal bedchamber was properly
guarded; after which he went to the temple of the goddess <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e2509" title="Source: Kali">K&acirc;l&icirc;</span>,
where he heard what seemed to him the voice of a woman, lamenting and
sobbing in great distress. Concealing himself behind the
<i>vad</i>-tree of the temple, he called out:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, poor woman? and why do you thus weep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once the cries ceased, and a voice from the temple
inquired:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou that thus questionest me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the minister knew that it was <span class="corr" id="xd26e2523"
title="Source: Kali">K&acirc;l&icirc;</span> herself <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>who
wept; so he threw himself on the ground, and, rising up,
exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, my mother!&mdash;<span class="corr" id="xd26e2530" title=
"Source: Kali">K&acirc;l&icirc;</span>!&mdash;Sambhavi!&mdash;Mahamayi!<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2533src" href="#xd26e2533" name="xd26e2533src">3</a> Why
should you thus weep?&rdquo; quoth <span class="corr" id="xd26e2544"
title="Source: Kali">K&acirc;l&icirc;</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use of my revealing it to thee? Canst thou render
any assistance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister said that, if he had but her favour, there was nothing
he could not do. Then the goddess told him that a calamity was about to
come upon the king, and fearing that such a good monarch was soon to
disappear from the world, she wept.</p>
<p>The thought of such a misfortune caused the minister to tremble; he
fell down before the goddess, and with tears streaming from his eyes
besought her to save him. <span class="corr" id="xd26e2553" title=
"Source: Kali">K&acirc;l&icirc;</span> was much gratified to observe
his devotion to his master, and thus addressed him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know, then, that your king will be in danger of three
calamities to-morrow, any one of which will be sufficient to cause his
death. First of all, early in the morning, there will come to the
palace several carts containing newly-reaped paddy grains. The king
will be delighted at this, and immediately order <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>a
measure of the paddy to be shelled and cooked for his morning meal.
Now, the field in which that paddy grew is the abode of serpents, two
of which were fighting together one day, when they emitted poison,
which has permeated those grains. Therefore, the morning meal of your
king will contain poison, but only in the first handful will it take
effect and he will die. Should he escape, another calamity is in store
for him at noon. The king of Vijayanagara will send to-morrow some
baskets of sweetmeats; in the first basket he has concealed arrows.
King Alakesa, suspecting no treachery, will order the first basket to
be opened in his presence, and will meet his death by that device. And
even should he escape this second calamity, a third will put an end to
his life to-morrow night. A deadly serpent will descend into his bed
room, by means of the chain of his hanging bed, and bite him. But,
should he be saved from this last misfortune, Alakesa will live long
and prosperously, till he attains the age of a hundred and twenty
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spake <span class="corr" id="xd26e2563" title=
"Source: Kali">K&acirc;l&icirc;</span>, in tones of sorrow, for she
feared that the king would lose his life by one of these three
calamities. The Minister prostrated himself on the ground, and said
that if the goddess would grant him her favour he was confident he
could contrive to avert all the threatened evils from the king.
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2566" title=
"Source: Kali">K&acirc;l&icirc;</span> smiled and disappeared; and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>Minister, taking her kind smile as a token of
her favour, returned home and slept soundly.</p>
<p>As soon as morning dawned, the First Minister arose, and having made
the customary ablutions, proceeded to the palace. He took care to
reveal to no one the important secret communicated to him by the
goddess&mdash;not even to his three colleagues. The sun was not yet two
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e2574" title=
"Source: gh&acirc;&#7789;ikas">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</span></i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2576src" href="#xd26e2576" name="xd26e2576src">4</a>
above the horizon when several carts containing the finest paddy
grains, specially selected for the king&rsquo;s use, came into the
courtyard of the palace. Alakesa was present, and ordered a measure of
it to be at once shelled and cooked. The coming in of the carts and the
king&rsquo;s order so exactly coincided with <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2585" title=
"Source: Kali&rsquo;s">K&acirc;l&icirc;&rsquo;s</span> words that the
Minister began to fear that he was quite unequal to the task of
averting the fatality; yet the recollection of the smile of the goddess
inspired him with fresh resolution, and he at once went to the
palace-kitchen and requested the servants to inform him when the king
was about to go to dinner. After issuing orders for the storing of the
grain, king Alakesa retired to perform his morning ablutions and other
religious duties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a carriage containing the jars of sweetmeats sent by the
king of Vijayanagara drove up to the palace, and the emissary who
accompanied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>the present, told the royal servants that his
master had commanded him to deliver it to king Alakesa in person. The
First Minister well understood the meaning of this, and, promising to
bring the king, went into the palace, caused one of the servants to be
dressed like Alakesa, and conducted him to the carriage. The officer of
the Vijayanagara king placed the first jar before the supposed Alakesa,
who at once opened it, when lo! there darted forth several arrows, one
of which pierced his heart, and he fell dead on the spot.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2592src" href="#xd26e2592" name="xd26e2592src">5</a>
In an instant the emissary was seized and bound, and the officers began
to lament the death of their good king. But the fatal occurrence spread
rapidly through the palace, and soon the real Alakesa made his
appearance on the scene. The officers now beheld one Alakesa dead and
fallen to the ground, pierced by the arrow, and another standing there
alive and well. The First Minister then related how, suspecting
treachery, he brought out a servant of the palace dressed like the
king, and how he had been slain in place of his royal master. Alakesa
thanked the Minister for having so ingeniously saved his life, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>went into the palace. Thus was one of the three
calamities to the king averted by the faithful Bodhaditya.</p>
<p>When it was the hour for dinner, the king and his courtiers all sat
down, with the exception of the First Minister, who remained standing,
without having taken a leaf for his own use. The king, observing this,
with a smile pointed out a leaf to him,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2599src" href="#xd26e2599" name="xd26e2599src">6</a> but
Bodhaditya would not sit; he wished to be near the king and to abstain
from eating on that occasion. So the king allowed him to have his own
way. The food having been served on the leaves, the hands of all,
including the king, were mingling the rice, <i><span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2608" title="Source: ghi">gh&icirc;</span></i>, and
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e2612" title=
"Source: dhal">dh&acirc;l</span></i> for the first course. Near the
king stood his faithful Minister Bodhaditya, and, when the king raised
the first handful to his mouth, &ldquo;Stop, my master,&rdquo; cried
he, &ldquo;I have long hoped for this handful as a present to me from
your royal hands. I pray you give it to me, and feast upon the rest of
the rice on your leaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was uttered more in a tone of command than of request, and the
king was highly incensed at what he naturally considered as insolence
on the part of the Minister. For such a request, especially when made
to a king, is deemed nothing less than <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>an insult, while to
refuse it is equally offensive. So, whatever thoughts may have passed
through Alakesa&rsquo;s mind, recollecting how the Minister had that
morning saved his life, he gave him the handful of rice, which
Bodhaditya received with delight, feeling grateful for the favour of
the goddess in being the means of averting this second calamity.</p>
<p>Far different, however, were the sentiments of the king and the
assembled company. One and all declared Bodhaditya to be an insolent,
proud fellow; but the king, while secretly blaming himself for having
allowed him to use so much familiarity, suppressed his anger, in
consideration of the important service the Minister had rendered
him.</p>
<p>On the approach of night the heart of the First Minister throbbed
violently, for the third calamity predicted by the goddess was yet to
be encountered. His watch being ended, before retiring to rest, he went
to examine the royal bedroom, where he saw the light burning brightly,
and the king and queen asleep side by side in the ornamented swing cot,
which was suspended from the roof by four chains. Presently, he
perceived, with horror, a fierce black snake, the smell of which is
enough to kill a man, slowly gliding down the chain near the head of
the queen. The Minister noiselessly went forward, and with a single
stroke of his sharp sword, cut the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151"
href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>venomous brute in two.
Bodhaditya, to avoid disturbing any person at such an hour of the
night, threw the pieces over the canopy of the bed, rejoicing at having
thus averted the third and last calamity. But a fresh horror then met
his eyes; a drop of the snake&rsquo;s poison had fallen on the bosom of
the queen, which was exposed in the carelessness of slumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, sacred goddess,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;why do you
thus raise up new obstacles in my efforts to avert the evil which you
predicted? I have done what I could to save the king, and in this last
attempt I have killed his beloved queen. What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus briefly reflected, he wiped off the poison from the
queen&rsquo;s bosom with the tip of his little finger, and, lest the
contact of the venom with his finger should endanger his own life, he
cut the tip of it off and threw it on the canopy. Just then the queen
awoke, and perceiving a man hastily leaving the room, she cried:
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister respectfully answered: &ldquo;Most venerable mother! I
am your son, Bodhaditya,&rdquo; and at once retired.</p>
<p>Upon this the queen thought within herself: &ldquo;Alas! is there
such a thing as a good man in the world? Hitherto I have regarded this
Bodhaditya as my son; but now he has basely taken the opportunity of
thus disgracing me when my lord and I were sound asleep. I shall inform
the king of this, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152"
name="pb152">152</a>]</span>and have that wretch&rsquo;s head struck
off before the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly she gently awakened the king, and with tears trickling
down her beauteous face, she told him what had occurred, and concluded
with these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Till now, my lord, I considered that I
was wife to you alone; but this night your First Minister has made me
doubt it, since to my question, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; he answered,
without any shame, &lsquo;I am Bodhaditya,&rsquo; and went
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing of this violation of the sanctity of his bedchamber,
Alakesa was greatly enraged, and determined to put to death such an
unprincipled servant, but first to communicate the affair to his three
other Ministers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the Second Minister&rsquo;s watch was over, he
went to inspect the guard at the royal bedchamber, and Alakesa hearing
his footsteps inquired who was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your servant, Bodhachandra, most royal lord,&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enter, Bodhachandra,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;I have
somewhat to communicate to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Alakesa, almost choking with rage, told him of the gross
offence of which his colleague the First Minister had been guilty, and
demanded to know whether any punishment could be too severe.
Bodhachandra humbled himself before the king, and thus
replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord, such a crime merits a heavy requital. Can one tie up
fire in one&rsquo;s cloth and think that as it is but a small spark it
will do us no harm? How, then, can we excuse even slight deviations
from the rules of propriety? Therefore, if Bodhaditya be really guilty,
he must be signally punished. But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154"

your Majesty the advisability of carefully inquiring into this matter
before proceeding to judgment. We ought to ascertain what reasons he
had for such a breach of the harem rules; for should we, carried away
by anger, act rashly in this affair, we may repent when repentance is
of no avail. As an example, I shall, with your Majesty&rsquo;s
permission relate a story.&rdquo; The king having at once given his
consent, the Second Minister began to relate the <span class=

<h3 class="main">Story of the Honest but Rash Hunter and His Faithful
Dog.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There dwelt in a certain forest a hunter named
Ugravira, who was lord of the woods, and as such, had to pay a fixed
sum of money to the king of the country. It happened once that the king
unexpectedly demanded of him one thousand five hundred
<i>pons</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2667src" href="#xd26e2667"
name="xd26e2667src">7</a> The hunter sold all his property and realised
only a thousand <i>pons</i>, and was perplexed how to procure the rest
of the required amount. At length he bethought him of his dog, which
was of the best kind, and was beloved by him more than anything else in
the whole world. He took his dog to an adjacent city, where he pledged
him to a merchant named Kubera for five hundred <i>pons</i>, at the
same time giving the merchant his bond for the loan. Before going away,
the hunter with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156"
name="pb156">156</a>]</span>tears in his eyes, thus addressed the
intelligent animal:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrigasimha, [<i>i.e.</i>, lion among beasts] O my faithful
friend, do not leave thy new master until I have paid him back the
money I have borrowed of him. Obey and serve him, even as thou hast
ever obeyed and served me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time after this, the merchant Kubera had to leave home and
proceed with his merchandise to foreign countries: so he called the
hunter&rsquo;s dog to his side, and bade him watch at his doors and
prevent the intrusion of robbers and other evil-disposed persons. The
dog indicated, both by his eyes and his tail, that he perfectly
understood his instructions. Then the merchant, having enjoined his
wife to feed the dog three times every day with rice and milk, set out
on his travels. The dog kept his watch outside the house, and for a few
days the merchant&rsquo;s wife fed him regularly three times a day. But
this kind treatment was not to continue. She had for her paramour a
wicked youth of the Setti caste, who, soon after the departure of
Kubera, became a constant visitor at the merchant&rsquo;s house. The
faithful dog instinctively surmised that his new master would not
approve of such conduct; so one night, when the youth was leaving the
house, Mrigasimha sprang upon him like an enraged lion, and seizing him
by the throat, sent the evildoer to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>the other world. The
merchant&rsquo;s wife hearing the scuffle, ran to the spot to save her
lover, but found him dead.</p>
<p>Though extremely grieved at the loss of her paramour, she had the
presence of mind to immediately carry the body to the garden at the
back of the house, where she concealed it in a great pit, and covered
it with earth and leaves, vainly thinking that she had thus concealed
her own shame. All this was not done, however, without being observed
by the watchful dog; and, henceforward, the merchant&rsquo;s wife hated
him with a deadly hatred. She no longer gave him food, and the poor
creature was fain to eat such grains of rice as he found adhering to
the leaves thrown out of the house after meals, still keeping guard at
the door.</p>
<p>After an absence of two months the merchant returned, and the dog,
the moment he saw him, ran up to him and rolled himself on the ground
at his feet; then seizing the merchant&rsquo;s cloth he dragged him to
the very spot in the garden where the youth&rsquo;s body was hidden,
and began to scratch the ground, at the same time looking into the
merchant&rsquo;s face and howling dismally, from which Kubera concluded
that the dog wished him to examine the place. Accordingly he dug up the
spot and discovered the body of the youth, whom, indeed, he had
suspected of being his wife&rsquo;s paramour. In a great fury he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>rushed into the house and commanded his wife, on
pain of instant death, to relate the particulars of this affair without
concealing anything. The wretched woman, seeing that her sin was
discovered, confessed all, upon which her husband exclaimed!&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgrace of womankind! you have not a fraction of the virtue
possessed by this faithful brute, which you have, out of revenge,
allowed to starve. But why should I waste words on thee? Happy am I in
having no children by thee! Depart, and let me see thy face no
more.&rdquo; So saying, he thrust her out of the house. Then the
merchant fed the dog with milk, rice and sugar, after which he said to
that lion of beasts (Mrigasimha, as he was called)&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou trusty friend, language fails to express my gratitude to

five hundred <i>pons</i> which I lent thy old master the hunter are as
nothing compared with thy services to me, by which I consider the debt
as more than paid. What must be the feelings of the hunter without thy
companionship? I now give thee leave to return to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merchant took the hunter&rsquo;s bond, and tearing it slightly
at the top as a token that it was cancelled, he placed it in the
dog&rsquo;s mouth and sent him back to his former master, and he at
once set off towards the forest.</p>
<p>Now by this time the hunter had contrived to save up the five
hundred <i>pons</i>, and with the money and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>the
interest due thereon, he was going to the merchant to redeem his bond
and reclaim his dog. To his great surprise he met Mrigasimha on the
way, and as soon as the dog perceived him he ran up to him to receive
his caresses. But the hunter immediately concluded that the poor brute,
in his eagerness to rejoin him, had run away from the merchant, and
determined to put him to death. Accordingly he plucked a creeper, and
fastening it round the dog&rsquo;s neck tied him to a branch of a tree,
and the faithful creature, who was expecting nothing but kindness from
his old master, was by him most cruelly strangled. The hunter then
continued his journey, and, on reaching the merchant&rsquo;s house, he
laid down the money before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said Kubera, &ldquo;the important
service your dog rendered me in killing my wife&rsquo;s paramour, has
amply repaid your debt, so I gave him permission to return to you, with
your bond in his mouth. Did you not meet him on your way? But why do
you look so horrified? What have you done to the dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hunter, to whom everything was now only too clear, threw himself
on the ground, like a huge tree cut at the root, and, after telling
Kubera how he had inconsiderately slain the faithful dog, stabbed
himself with his dagger. The merchant grieved at the death both of the
dog and the hunter, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href=
"#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>would not have occurred had he
waited until Ugravira came to redeem his bond, snatched the weapon out
of the hunter&rsquo;s breast and also stabbed himself. The news of this
tragedy soon reached the forest, and the wife of the hunter, not
wishing to survive her lord, threw herself into a well and was drowned.
Lastly, even the wife of the merchant, finding that so many fatalities
were due to her own misconduct, and that she was despised by the very
children in the streets, put an end to her wretched life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; added the Second Minister, &ldquo;five lives
were lost in consequence of the hunter&rsquo;s rashness. Wherefore I
would respectfully beseech your Majesty to investigate the case of
Bodhaditya, and to refrain from acting merely under the influence of
anger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, Bodhachandra obtained leave to retire to his own
house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=

Bodhavyapaka, the Third Minister of king Alakesa, went to see whether
the royal bedchamber was properly guarded, and the king, summoning him
to his presence, told him of the First Minister&rsquo;s crime, upon
which Bodhavyapaka, after making due obeisance, thus spake:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most noble king, such a grave crime should be severely

<h3 class="main">Story of the Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&rsquo;s Wife and the
Mungoose.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the banks of the Ganges, which also flows by the
most holy city of Banaras, there is a town named Mithila, where dwelt a
very poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751; called Vidyadhara. He had no children,
and to compensate for this want, he and his wife tenderly nourished in
their house a mungoose&mdash;a species of weasel. It was their all in
all&mdash;their younger son, their elder daughter&mdash;their elder
son, their younger daughter, so fondly did they regard that little
creature. The god Visvesvara and his spouse Visalakshi observed this,
and had pity for the unhappy pair; so by their divine power they
blessed them with a son. This most welcome addition to their family did
not alienate the affections of the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; and his wife
from the mungoose; on the contrary, their attachment increased, for
they believed that it was because of their having adopted the pet that
a son had been born to them. So the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>child and the
mungoose were brought up together, as twin brothers, in the same
cradle.</p>
<p>It happened one day when the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; had gone out to beg
alms of the pious and charitable, that his wife went into the garden to
cull some pot-herbs, leaving the child asleep in his cradle, and by his
side the mungoose kept guard. An old serpent, which was living in the
well in the garden, crept into the house and under the cradle, and was
beginning to climb into it to bite the child when the mungoose fiercely
attacked it and tore it into several pieces, thus saving the life of
the Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&rsquo;s little son, and the venomous snake,
that came to slay, itself lay dead beneath the cradle.</p>
<p>Pleased at having performed such an exploit, the mungoose ran into
the garden to show the Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&rsquo;s wife its
blood-smeared mouth, but she rashly mistook the deliverer of her child
for his destroyer, and with one stroke of the knife in her hand with
which she was cutting herbs she killed the faithful creature, and then
hastened into the house to see her dead son. But there she found the
child in his cradle alive and well, only crying at the absence of his
little companion, the mungoose, and under the cradle lay the great
serpent cut to pieces. The real state of affairs was now evident, and
the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; presently returning home, his wife told him of
her rash act and then put an end to her life. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, in his turn, disconsolate
at the death of the mungoose and his wife, first slew his child and
then killed himself.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;And thus,&rdquo; added the Third Minister, &ldquo;by one rash
act four creatures perished, so true is it that precipitation results
in a series of calamities. Do not, then, condemn Bodhaditya before his
guilt is clearly proved.&rdquo; Alakesa, having given Bodhachandra the
signal to retire, he quitted the presence and went home.</p>
<p>When the watch of the Fourth Minister, Bodhavibhishana, was
terminated, he visited the private apartments of the king (who had been
meanwhile pondering over the stories he had heard), and was called into
the sleeping chamber by Alakesa, and informed of his colleague&rsquo;s
unpardonable offence. The Minister, after due prostration, thus
addressed his royal master:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great king, I can scarcely bring myself to believe that
Bodhaditya could ever be guilty of such a crime, and I would
respectfully remind your Majesty that it would not be consistent with
your world-wide reputation for wisdom and justice were you to pronounce
judgment in this case without having inquired into all the
circumstances. Evil and injustice result from hasty decisions and
actions, of which a striking illustration is furnished in the

<h3 class="main">Story of the Faithless Wife and the Ungrateful Blind
Man.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the town of Mithila there lived a young
Br&acirc;hma&#7751; who, having had a quarrel with his father-in-law,
set out on a pilgrimage to Banaras. Going through a forest he met a
blind man, whose wife was leading him by means of a stick, one end of
which she held in her hand, and her husband holding the other end was
following her. She was young and fair of face, and the pilgrim made
signs to her that she should go with him and leave her blind husband
behind. The proposal thus signified pleased this wanton woman, so she
bade her husband sit under a tree for a few minutes while she went and
plucked him a ripe mango. The blind man sat down accordingly, and his
wife went away with the Br&acirc;hma&#7751;. After waiting a long time
in expectation of his wife&rsquo;s return, and no person coming near
him, (for it was an unfrequented place), her infidelity became
painfully apparent to him, and he bitterly cursed both her and the
villain who had enticed her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>away from him. For six days he
remained at the foot of the tree, in woeful condition, without a morsel
of rice or a drop of water, and he was well nigh dead, when at length
he heard the sound of footsteps near him, and cried faintly for help. A
man of the Setti caste and his wife came up to him, and inquired how he
happened to be in such a plight. The blind man told them how his wife
had deserted him, and gone away with a young <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2766" title="Source: Brahman">Br&acirc;hma&#7751;</span> whom
they had met, leaving him there alone and helpless. His story excited
the compassion of the Setti and his wife. They gave him to eat of the
small quantity of rice they had with them, and, having supplied him
with water to quench his thirst, the Setti bade his wife lead him with
his stick. The woman, though somewhat reluctant to walk thus in company
with a man who was not her husband, yet, reflecting that charitable
actions ought never to be left undone, complied with her lord&rsquo;s
request, and began to lead the blind man. After travelling in this
manner for a day, the three reached a town, and took up their abode for
the night in the house of a friend of the Setti, where the latter and
his wife gave the blind man a share of their rice before tasting a
morsel themselves. At daybreak the next morning they advised him to try
to provide for himself in some way in that town, and prepared to resume
their journey. But the blind man, forgetting all the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>kindness they had shown him, began to raise an
alarm, crying out:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no king in this city to protect me and give me my
rights? Here is a Setti rascal taking away my wife with him! As I am
blind, she denies that I am her husband, and follows that rogue! But
will not the king give me justice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people in the street at once reported these words to the king,
who caused inquiry to be made into the matter. The fact of the
Setti&rsquo;s wife having led the blind man, seemed to indicate that
the latter, and not the Setti, was the woman&rsquo;s husband, and
foolishly concluded that both the Setti and his wife were the real
criminals. Accordingly he sentenced the Setti to the gallows, because
he attempted to entice away a married woman, and his wife to be burnt
in the kiln, as she wished to forsake her husband, and he a blind man.
When these sentences were pronounced the blind man was thunder-struck.
The thought that by a deliberate lie he had caused the death of two
innocent persons now stung him to the heart. By this lie he expected
that the Setti only should be punished, and that his wife would be made
over to him as his own wife, but now he found she also was condemned to
death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vile wretch that I am!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I do not know
what sins I committed in my former life to be thus blind now. My real
wife, too, deserted me; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href=
"#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>and I, heaping sins upon sins,
have now by a false report sent to death an innocent man and his wife,
who rescued me from a horrible fate and tended to all my wants last
night. O, <span class="corr" id="xd26e2779" title=
"Source: Mahesvara">Mah&ecirc;&#347;vara</span>! what punishment you
have in reserve for me I know not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This soliloquy, being overheard by some by-standers, was
communicated to the king, who bitterly reproaching himself for having
acted so rashly, at once released the good Setti and his wife, and
caused the ungrateful blind man to be burnt in the kiln.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, you see, my lord,&rdquo; added the fourth Minister,
&ldquo;how nearly that king had plunged himself into a gulf of crime by
his rashness. Therefore, my most noble king, I would respectfully and
humbly request you to consider well the case of Bodhaditya, and punish
him severely if he be found really guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Having thus spoken, the Fourth Minister obtained leave to depart.

<p class="first">The night was now over: darkness, the harbourer of
vice, fled away; the day dawned. King Alakesa left his bedchamber,
bathed and made his religious ablutions, and, after breakfasting,
summoned a council of all his father&rsquo;s old ministers and
advisers. Alakesa took his seat in the midst of the assembly; anger was
clearly visible in his countenance; his eyes had lost their natural
expression and had turned very red; his breath was as hot as that of a
furnace. He thus addressed them:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know ye all, the ministers of my father and of myself, that
last night, during the first watch, my First Minister, Bodhaditya,
while I and my queen were asleep in our chamber, came and touched with
his finger the bosom of my queen. Consider well the gravity of this
crime, and express your opinions as to what punishment he
merits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spake king Alakesa, but all the ministers, not knowing what
answer to return, hung down <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href=
"#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>their heads in silence. Among
those present was an aged minister named Manuniti, who called
Bodhaditya to his side and privately learned the whole story. He then
humbly bowed before the king, and thus spake:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most noble king, men are not always all-wise, and, before
replying to your Majesty&rsquo;s question, I beg permission to relate
in your presence the story of a king in whose reign a certain
benevolent action was repaid with disgrace and ignominy:&mdash;

<h3 class="main">Story of the Wonderful Mango Fruit.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the banks of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e2812"
title="Source: K&aacute;v&eacute;ri">K&acirc;v&ecirc;r&icirc;</span>
there was a city called Tiruvidaimarudur, where ruled a king named
Chakraditya. In that city there lived a poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751; and
his wife, who, having no children, brought up in their house a young
parrot as tenderly as if it had been their own offspring. One day the
parrot was sitting on the roof of the house, basking itself in the
morning sun, when a large flock of parrots flew past, talking to each
other about certain mango fruits. The Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&rsquo;s
parrot asked them what were the peculiar properties of those fruits,
and was informed that beyond the seven oceans there was a great mango
tree, the fruit of which gave perpetual youth to the person who ate of
it, however old and infirm he might be. On hearing of this wonder the
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&rsquo;s parrot requested permission to accompany
them, which being granted, they all continued their flight. When at
length <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>they arrived at the mango tree, all ate of its
fruit; but the Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&rsquo;s parrot reflected:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not be right for me to eat this fruit; I am young,
while my adopted parents, the poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751; and his wife are
very old. So I shall give them this fruit, and they will become young
and blooming by eating it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that same evening the good parrot brought the fruit to the
Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, and explained to him its extraordinary properties.
But the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; thought within himself:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a beggar. What matters it if I become young and live for
ever, or else die this very moment? Our king is very good and
charitable. If such a great man should eat of this fruit and renew his
youth, he would confer the greatest benefit on mankind. Therefore I
will give this mango to our good king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In pursuance of this self-denying resolution, the poor
Br&acirc;hma&#7751; proceeded to the palace and presented the fruit to
the king, at the same time relating how he had obtained it and its
qualities. The king richly rewarded the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; for his
gift, and sent him away. Then he began to reflect thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a fruit which can bestow perpetual youth on the
person who eats it. I should gain this great boon for myself alone, and
what happiness could I expect under such circumstances unless
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>shared by my friends and subjects? I shall
therefore not eat this mango-fruit, but plant it carefully in my
garden, and it will in time become a tree, which will bear much fruit
having the same wonderful virtue, and my subjects shall, every one, eat
of the fruit, and, with myself, be endowed with everlasting
youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, calling his gardener, the king gave him the fruit, and he
planted it in the royal presence. In due course of time the fruit grew
into a fine tree, and during the spring season it began to bud and
blossom and bear fruit. The king, having fixed upon an auspicious day
for cutting one of the mango-fruits, gave it to his domestic chaplain,
who was ninety years old, in order that his youth should be renewed.
But no sooner had the priest tasted it than he fell down dead. At this
unexpected calamity the king was both astonished and deeply grieved.
When the old priest&rsquo;s wife heard of her husband&rsquo;s sudden
death she came and prayed the king to allow her to perform <i>sati</i>
with him on the same funeral pyre, which increased the king&rsquo;s
sorrow; but he gave her the desired permission, and himself
superintended all the ceremonies of the cremation. King Chakraditya
then sent for the poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, and demanded of him how he
had dared to present a poisonous fruit to his king. The
Br&acirc;hma&#7751; replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord, I brought up a young parrot in my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>house, in order to console me for having no son.
That parrot brought me the fruit one day, and told me of its wonderful
properties. Believing that the parrot spoke the truth, I presented it
to your Majesty, never for a moment suspecting it to be
poisonous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king listened to the poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&rsquo;s words, but
thought that the poor priest&rsquo;s death should be avenged. So he
consulted his ministers who recommended, as a slight punishment, that
the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; should be deprived of his left eye. This was
done accordingly, and, on his return home, when his wife saw his
condition, she asked the reason of such mutilation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the parrot we have fostered
so tenderly is the cause of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they resolved to break the neck of the treacherous bird. But the
parrot, having overheard their conversation, thus addressed
them:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My kind foster parents, everyone must be rewarded for the
good actions or punished for the evil deeds of his previous life. I
brought you the fruit with a good intention, but my sins in my former
life have given it a different effect. Therefore I pray you to kill me
and bury me with a little milk in a pit. And, after my funeral ceremony
is over, I request you to undertake a pilgrimage to Banaras to expiate
your own sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the old Br&acirc;hma&#7751; and his wife killed their pet
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>parrot and buried it as directed, after which,
overcome with grief, they set out on a pilgrimage to the Holy City.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the king commanded his gardener to set guards over the
poison-tree, and to allow no one to eat of its fruit; and all the
inhabitants soon came to know that the king had a mango tree in his
garden, the fruit of which was deadly poison. Now, there was in the
city an old washerwoman, who had frequent quarrels with her
daughter-in-law, and one day, being weary of life, she left the house,
threatening to eat of the poison tree and die.</p>
<p>The young parrot who was killed for having brought the poisonous
mango-fruit was re-born as a green parrot, and was waiting for an
opportunity to demonstrate the harmless nature of the tree; and when he
saw the old woman approach with a determination to put an end to her
life by eating of its fruit, he plucked one with his beak and dropped
it down before her. The old woman rejoiced that fate sanctioned her
death, and greedily ate the fruit, when lo! instead of dying she became
young and blooming again. Those who had seen her leave the house a
woman over sixty years of age were astonished on seeing her return as a
handsome girl of sixteen and learning that the wonderful transformation
was caused by the supposed poisonous mango-tree. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p>The strange news soon reached the king, who, in order to test the
tree still further, ordered another fruit of it to be brought and gave
it to a goldsmith of more than ninety years of age, who had embezzled
some gold which had been entrusted to him to make into ornaments for
the ladies of the palace, and was on that account undergoing
imprisonment. When he had eaten the fruit, he, in his turn, became a
young man of sixteen. The king was now convinced that the fruit of the
mango-tree, so far from being poisonous, had the power of converting
decrepit age into lusty and perennial youth. But how had the old priest
died by eating of it?</p>
<p>It was by a mere accident. One day a huge serpent was sleeping on a
branch of the mango-tree, and its head hung over one of the fruit;
poison dropped from its mouth and fell on the rind of that fruit; the
gardener, who had no knowledge of this, when asked to bring a fruit for
the priest, happened to bring the one on which the poison had fallen,
and the priest having eaten it, died.</p>
<p>And now the king caused proclamation to be made throughout his
kingdom that all who pleased might come and partake of the mango-fruit,
and everyone ate of it and became young. But king Chakaraditya&rsquo;s
heart burnt within him at the remembrance of his ill-treatment of the
poor Br&acirc;hma&#7751;, who had returned with his wife from Banaras.
So <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>he sent for him, explained his mistake, and gave
him a fruit to eat, which, having tasted, the aged Br&acirc;hma&#7751;
became young and his eye was also restored to him. But the greatest
loss of all, that of the parrot who brought the fruit from beyond the
seven oceans, remained irreparable.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Thus, my lord,&rdquo; continued the old minister, Manuniti,
&ldquo;it behoves us not to act precipitately in this affair of
Bodhaditya, which we must carefully sift before expressing our opinion
as to the punishment he may deserve at your majesty&rsquo;s

banks. One day a young Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; pilgrim came and sat down to
rest by the side of the stream, and, finding the place very cool and
shady, he resolved to bathe, perform his religious ablutions, and make
his dinner off the rice which he carried tied up in a bundle.</p>
<p>Three days before there had come to the same spot an old
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; whose years numbered more than three score and ten;
he had quarrelled with his family, and had fled from his house to die.
Since he had reached that place he had tasted no food, and the young
pilgrim found him lying in a pitiable state, and placed near him a
portion of his rice. The old man arose, and proceeded to the rivulet in
order to wash his feet and hands, and pronounce a holy incantation or
two before tasting the food.</p>
<p>While thus engaged a kite, carrying in its beak a huge serpent,
alighted upon the tree at the foot of which was the rice given by the
pilgrim to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=

serpent some of its poison dropped on the rice, and the old
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, in his hunger, did not observe it on his return;
he greedily devoured some of the rice, and instantly fell down
dead.</p>
<p>The young pilgrim, seeing him prostrate on the ground, ran to help
him, but found that life was gone; and concluding that the old
man&rsquo;s hasty eating after his three days&rsquo; fast must have
caused his death, and being unwilling to leave his corpse to be
devoured by kites and jackals, he determined to cremate it before
resuming his journey. With this object he ran to the neighbouring
village, and, reporting to the people what had occurred on the tope,
requested their assistance in cremating the old man&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>The villagers, however, suspected that the young pilgrim had killed
and robbed the old Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;; so they laid hold of him, and,
after giving him a severe flogging, imprisoned him in the village
temple of <span class="corr" id="xd26e2900" title=
"Source: Kali">K&acirc;l&icirc;</span>. Alas! what a reward was this
for his kind hospitality! and how was he repaid for his
beneficence!</p>
<p>The unhappy pilgrim gave vent to his sorrows in the form of verses
in praise of the goddess in whose temple he was a prisoner; for he was
a great <span class="corr" id="xd26e2905" title=
"Source: Pandit">Pa&#7751;&#7693;it</span>, versed in the four
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e2909" title=

"corr" id="xd26e2913" title=
"Source: Sastras">&#346;&acirc;stras</span></i>, and the sixty-four
varieties of knowledge. On hearing the pilgrim&rsquo;s verses, the rage
of the goddess descended upon the villagers, who had so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>rashly accused and punished him for a crime of
which he was innocent. Suddenly the whole village was destroyed by
fire, and the people lost all their property, and were houseless. In
their extremity they went to the temple of <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2918" title="Source: Kali">K&acirc;l&icirc;</span>, and humbly
requested the goddess to inform them of the cause of the calamity which
had thus unexpectedly come upon them. The goddess infused herself into
the person of one of the villagers, and thus responded:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know ye, unkind villagers, that ye have most unjustly
scourged and imprisoned in our presence an innocent, charitable, and
pious Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;. The old man died from the effects of the
poison, which dropped from a serpent&rsquo;s mouth on some rice at the
foot of a tree when it was being devoured by a kite. Ye did not know of
this; nevertheless ye have maltreated a good man without first making
due inquiry as to his guilt or innocence. For this reason we visited
your village with this calamity. Beware, and henceforward avoid such
sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, <span class="corr" id="xd26e2925" title=

whom she had manifested herself.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2928src"

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=

title="Source: grevious">grievous</span> error into which they had
fallen. They released the good pilgrim and implored his forgiveness,
which he readily granted. And thus was an innocent man charged with
murder in return for his benevolent actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; continued Bodhaditya, &ldquo;my most noble
sovereign, I have this day had to endure the infamy of having violated
the harem for saving your valuable life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then sent for a thief who was undergoing imprisonment, and gave
him the handful of rice which he had the preceding day snatched from
the king at dinner, and the thief having eaten it, instantly died. He
next caused a servant to go to the royal bed-chamber, and fetch from
the canopy of the couch the pieces of the serpent and his little
finger-tip, which he laid before the wonder-struck king and the
counsellors, and then addressed his majesty as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My most noble king, and ye wise counsellors, it is known to
you all that we four ministers keep watch over the town during the four
quarters of the night, and mine is the first watch. Well, while I was
on duty the day before yesterday, I heard a weeping voice in the
direction of the temple. I proceeded to the spot, and discovered the
goddess sobbing bitterly. She related to me how three calamities
awaited the king on the morrow. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>first of them was the
arrows despatched by the king of Vijayanagara as sweetmeats to our
Sovereign; the second was the poisoned rice, and the third the serpent.
In trying to avert these calamities, I have committed the offence of
entering the harem.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>And he thereupon explained the whole affair from first to last.</p>
<p>King Alakesa and the whole assembly were highly delighted at the
fidelity and devotion of Bodhaditya; for it was now very evident that
he had done nothing amiss, but had saved the life of the king on three
occasions, and indeed also the life of the queen by wiping off the
serpent&rsquo;s poison which had fallen on her bosom. Then Alakesa
related the following story in explanation of the proverb:&mdash;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the country of Uttara there lived a
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; named Kusalanatha, who had a wife and six sons. All
lived in a state of prosperity for some time, but the entrance of
Saturn into the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;&rsquo;s horoscope turned everything
upside down. The once prosperous Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; became poor, and
was reduced to go to the neighbouring woods to gather bamboo rice with
which to feed his hungry family.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2961src"
href="#xd26e2961" name="xd26e2961src">11</a></p>
<p>One day while plucking the bamboo ears, he saw a bush close by in
flames, in the midst of which was a serpent struggling for its life.
The Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; at once ran to its rescue, and stretching
towards it a long green stick the reptile crept on to it and escaped
from the flames, and then spread its hood and with a hissing sound
approached to sting its rescuer. The Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; began to weep
and bewail his folly in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>having saved the ungrateful
creature, at which the serpent asked him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, why do you weep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the old man: &ldquo;You now purpose to kill me; is this the
reward for my having saved your life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, you have rescued me from a terrible death, but how am I
to appease my hunger?&rdquo; replied the serpent.</p>
<p>And quoth the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, &ldquo;You speak of your hunger,
but who is to feed my old wife and six hungry children at my
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The serpent, seeing the anxiety of the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, emitted
a precious gem from its hood, and bade him take it home and give it to
his wife for household expenses, after which to return to the wood to
be devoured. The old man agreed, and, solemnly promising to return
without fail, went home. Having given the gem to his family, and told
them of his pact with the serpent, the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; went back to
the wood. The serpent had meanwhile reflected upon its own base
ingratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it right,&rdquo; said it to itself, &ldquo;to kill him who
saved me from the flames? No! I shall rather perish of hunger, if I
cannot find a prey to-day, than slay my protector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So when the old Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; appeared, true to his word, the
serpent presented him with another valuable gem, and after expressing a
wish that he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>should live long and happily with his wife and
children, went its own way, while the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; returned
joyously to his home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even as the serpent purposed acting towards its
benefactor,&rdquo; continued the king, &ldquo;so did I, in my rage,
intend putting to death my faithful minister and the protector of my
life, Bodhaditya; and to free myself from this grievous sin there is no
penance I should not undergo.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Then king Alakesa ordered a thousand Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;s to be fed
every day during his life, and many rich gifts to be distributed in
temples as atonement for his great error. And from that day Bodhaditya
and his three colleagues enjoyed still more of the royal favour. With
those four faithful ministers king Alakesa lived a most happy life and
had a most prosperous reign.</p>

<p class="first">In a remote wood there lived a monkey, and one day
while he was eating wood-apples, a sharp thorn from the tree ran into
the tip of his tail, he tried his best to get it out but could not. So
he proceeded to the nearest village, and calling the barber asked him
to oblige him by removing the thorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend barber,&rdquo; said the monkey, &ldquo;a thorn has run
into my tail. Kindly remove it and I will reward you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barber took up his razor and began to examine the tail; but as
he was cutting out the thorn he cut off the tip of the tail. The monkey
was greatly enraged and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend barber, give me back my tail. If you cannot do that,
give me your razor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barber was now in a difficulty, and as he could not replace the
tip of the tail he had to give up his razor to the monkey. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>The monkey, went back to the wood with his razor thus trickishly
acquired. On the way he met an old woman, who was cutting fuel from a
dried-up tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, grandmother,&rdquo; said the monkey, &ldquo;the
tree is very hard. You had better use this sharp razor, and you will
cut your fuel easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor woman was very pleased, and took the razor from the monkey.
In cutting the wood she, of course, blunted the razor, and the monkey
seeing his razor thus spoiled, said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, you have spoiled my razor. So you must either
give me your fuel or get me a better razor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman was not able to procure another razor. So she gave the
monkey her fuel and returned to her house bearing no load that day.</p>
<p>The roguish monkey now put the bundle of dry fuel on his head and
proceeded to a village to sell it. There he met an old woman seated by
the roadside and making puddings. Said the monkey to her:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, grandmother, you are making puddings and your
fuel is already exhausted. Use mine also and make more
cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady thanked him for his kindness and used his fuel for her
puddings. The cunning monkey waited till the last stick of his fuel was
burnt up, and then he said to the old woman<span class="corr" id=

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, grandmother, return me my fuel or give me all
your puddings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was unable to return him the fuel, and so had to give him all
her puddings.</p>
<p>The monkey with the basket of puddings on his head walked and walked
till he met a <i>Paraiya</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e3046src" href=
"#xd26e3046" name="xd26e3046src">2</a> coming with a tom-tom towards
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Paraiya,&rdquo; said the monkey, &ldquo;I have a
basketful of puddings to give you. Will you, in return, present me with
your tom-tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Paraiya</i> gladly agreed, as he was then very hungry, and
had nothing with him to eat.</p>
<p>The monkey now ascended with the tom-tom to the topmost branch of a
big tree and there beat his drum most triumphantly, saying in honour of
his several tricks:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost my tail and got a razor; <i>&#7693;um

<p class="first">Corresponding to this English proverb, there is one in
Tamil&mdash;<i>Ahambh&acirc; vam &acirc;lai
al&#804;ikkum</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Self-pride brings destruction;&rdquo;
and the following story is related by the common folk to illustrate
it.</p>
<p>In a certain village there lived ten cloth merchants, who always
went about together. Once upon a time they had travelled far afield,
and were returning home with a great deal of money which they had
obtained by selling their wares. Now there happened to be a dense
forest near their village, and this they reached early one morning. In
it there lived three notorious robbers, of whose existence the traders
had never heard, and while they were still in the middle of it, the
robbers stood before them, with swords and cudgels in their hands, and
ordered them to lay down all they had. The traders had no weapons with
them, and so, though they were many more in number, they had to submit
themselves to the robbers, who took away everything from them, even the
very clothes they wore, and gave to each <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>only a small
loin-cloth (<i>la&#7749;g&ocirc;&#7789;&icirc;</i>), a span in breadth
and a cubit in length.</p>
<p>The idea that they had <span class="corr" id="xd26e3104" title=
"Source: conquerred">conquered</span> ten men, and plundered all their
property, now took possession of the robbers&rsquo; minds. They seated
themselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered, and
ordered them to dance to them before returning home. The merchants now
mourned their fate. They had lost all they had, except their chief
essential, the <i>la&#7749;g&ocirc;&#7789;&icirc;</i>, and still the
robbers were not satisfied, but ordered them to dance.</p>
<p>There was, among the ten merchants, one who was very intelligent. He
pondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends, the
dance they would have to perform, and the magnificent manner in which
the three robbers had seated themselves on the grass. At the same time
he observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground, in
the assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders, who were now
commencing to dance. So he took the lead in the dance, and, as a song
is always sung by the leader on such occasions, to which the rest keep
time with hands and feet, he thus began to sing:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="ta-latn" class="lgouter xd26e3112">

</div>
<p class="first">The robbers were all uneducated, and thought that the
leader was merely singing a song as usual. So it was in one sense; for
the leader commenced from a distance, and had sung the song over twice,
before he and his companions commenced to approach the robbers. They
had understood his meaning, which, however, even to the best educated,
unless trained to the technical expressions of trade, would have
remained a riddle.</p>
<p>When two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of
a purchaser, they use an enigmatic form of language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the price of this cloth?&rdquo; one trader will ask
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Puli</i> rupees,&rdquo; another will reply, meaning
&ldquo;ten rupees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meant
unless he be acquainted with trade technicalities.<a class="noteref"

rules of this secret language <i>tiru</i> means &ldquo;three,&rdquo;
<i>puli</i> means &ldquo;ten,&rdquo; and <i>&#347;&acirc;vana</i> (or

leader by his song meant to hint to his fellow-traders that they were
ten men, the robbers only three, that if three pounced upon each of the
robbers, nine of them could hold them down, while the remaining one
bound the robbers&rsquo; hands and feet.</p>
<p>The three thieves, glorying in their victory, and little
understanding the meaning of the song and the intentions of the
dancers, were proudly seated chewing betel and <i>tamb&acirc;k</i>
(tobacco). Meanwhile the song was sung a third time. <i>T&acirc; tai
t&ocirc;m</i> had left the lips of the singer; and, before
<i>tadinga&#7751;a</i> was out of them, the traders separated into
parties of three, and each party pounced upon a thief. The remaining
one&mdash;the leader himself, for to him the other nine left the
conclusion&mdash;tore up into long narrow strips a large piece of
cloth, six cubits long, and tied the hands and feet of the robbers.
These were entirely humbled now, and rolled on the ground like three
bags of rice!</p>
<p>The ten traders now took back all their property, and armed
themselves with the swords and cudgels of their enemies; and when they
reached their village, they often amused their friends and relatives by
relating their adventure.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3203src" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain town there reigned a king named
Patn&icirc;priya,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3217src" href="#xd26e3217"
name="xd26e3217src">1</a> to whose court, a poor old
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, named P&acirc;pabh&icirc;ru,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3222src" href="#xd26e3222" name="xd26e3222src">2</a> came every
morning, with a yellow lime in his hand, and presenting it to the king,
pronounced a benediction in Tamil:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="ta-latn" class="lgouter xd26e3112">
<p class="line">Nanmai vidaitt&acirc;l, nanmai vil&#804;aiyum:</p>
<p class="line">T&icirc;mai vidaitt&acirc;l, t&icirc;mai vijaiyum:</p>
<p class="line">Nanmaiyum t&icirc;maiyum pinvara

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;If good is sown, then good will grow:</p>
<p class="line">If bad is sown, then bad will grow:</p>
<p class="line">Thus good or bad the end will show.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The king respected as much the noble benediction of
the Br&acirc;hma&#7751; as he did his grey hairs.</p>
<p>In this way the presentation of the fruit continued daily, though
the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; had nothing to request from the king, but
simply wished to pay his respects. On observing that he had no ulterior
motives, but was merely actuated by <i>r&acirc;jas&ecirc;vana</i>, or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>duty to his king, the king&rsquo;s admiration
for his old morning visitor increased the more.</p>
<p>After presenting the fruit the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; waited upon his
sovereign till his <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e3253" title=
"Source: p&ucirc;ja">p&ucirc;j&acirc;</span></i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3255src" href="#xd26e3255" name="xd26e3255src">3</a> was over,
and then went home where his wife kept ready for him all the requisites
for his own <i>p&ucirc;j&acirc;</i>. P&acirc;pabh&icirc;ru then partook
of what dinner his wife had prepared for him. Sometimes, however, a
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; neighbour sent him an invitation to dinner, which
he at once accepted. For his father, before he breathed his last, had
called him to his bedside, and, pronouncing his last benediction, had
thus advised him in Tamil:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd26e3112">
<p class="line">K&acirc;lai s&ocirc;ttai tal&#803;l&#803;&acirc;de,</p>
<p class="line">Ka&#7751;&#7751;il Ka&#7751;&#7693;adai

</div>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Morning meal do thou never spurn,</p>
<p class="line">Nor say thou what thine eyes discern,</p>
<p class="line">But serve thy king for fame to earn.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Thus it was that P&acirc;pabh&icirc;ru began his
visits to the king, nor did he ever reject an invitation to dinner,
though it might come at a very inconvenient time.</p>
<p>Now on a certain <i>&ecirc;k&acirc;da&#347;i</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3282src" href="#xd26e3282" name="xd26e3282src">4</a> morning,
P&acirc;pabh&icirc;ru went to the king to pay his respects as usual,
with the lime and the benediction, but found that he had gone to his
<i>p&ucirc;j&acirc;</i> and so followed him there. On <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>seeing the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, the king&rsquo;s
face glowed with pleasure, and he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My most revered god on earth,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3292src" href="#xd26e3292" name="xd26e3292src">5</a> I thought
that some ill must have befallen you, when I missed you in the
council-hall this morning; but praised be Param&ecirc;&#347;vara for
having sent you to me, though it is a little late. I never do my
<i>p&ucirc;j&acirc;</i> without placing my scimitar by the side of the
god, but last night I left it in my queen&rsquo;s room. It is under the
pillow of the couch on which I usually sleep. Until you came I could
find no suitable person to fetch it for me, and so I have waited for
you. Would you kindly take the trouble to fetch it for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; was only too glad of the opportunity
thus presented to him of serving his king, and so he ran to the
<i>harem</i> and into the room where the king usually slept. The queen
was a very wicked woman and always having secret meetings with
courtiers of her husband, so when P&acirc;pabh&icirc;ru returned he
surprised the queen and one of her lovers walking in the garden, he
went through, however, to the king&rsquo;s room, and lifting up the
king&rsquo;s pillow felt for the scimitar, and went away. True however,
to his father&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Nor say thou what thine eyes
discern,&rdquo; he never opened his lips and went his way with a heavy
heart. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>The queen and her wicked suitor were greatly alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That rogue of an old Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; has seen us and may
report to the king at the first opportunity,&rdquo; faltered the
minister.</p>
<p>But the queen, as bold in words as in sin, said; &ldquo;I will have
him murdered before the sun rises. Wait you here. I shall inform the
king of what is to be done and report the result to you, and then you
may go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, she went and stood before her royal husband who was at
his worship. Patn&icirc;priya rose up and asked her the reason of her
sudden appearance.</p>
<p>Said she, &ldquo;Your Majesty seems to think the whole world as
innocent as yourself. That wretched old Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, though his
hair is as white as milk, has not forgotten his younger days, he asked
me to run away with him. If you do not order his death before to-morrow
morning, I shall kill myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king was much vexed with what he heard, and all the regard he
had for the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; disappeared at once. He called two of
his executioners and spoke to them thus before his wife:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take to the east gate of the town a large iron caldron, and
keep it boiling to the brim with gingely oil.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3323src" href="#xd26e3323" name="xd26e3323src">6</a> A certain
person shall come to you in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198"
href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>morning and ask you,
&lsquo;Is it all done?&rsquo; Without observing who he is, tie his
hands and feet and throw him into the boiling oil. When he has been
boiled to death, put out the fire and empty out the oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The executioners received the order and went away to perform their
terrible duty. The queen, too, glad at heart at having thus
successfully arranged for the murder of the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;,
reported the fact to the minister, but said nothing about the special
question to be put by the victim. The minister, much pleased, went to
his palace and waited for news of the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;&rsquo;s
death.</p>
<p>When his <i>p&ucirc;j&acirc;</i> was over the king sent for
P&acirc;pabh&icirc;ru, and the poor Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, never having
before been sent for at such a time, made his appearance with a beating
heart. When he arrived the king, in order to arouse no suspicion in his
mind, said gently to him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, to-morrow morning, when you go
to make your ablutions, pass by the east gate. There you will see two
persons seated by the side of a large caldron. Ask them, &lsquo;Is it
all done?&rsquo; And whatever reply they give you, come and communicate
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spoke the king, firmly believing that P&acirc;pabh&icirc;ru
would never return to him; while the Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, glad to be
able to serve the king a second time next morning, went home and slept
soundly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>Early in the morning, even a
<i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</i> before his usual time, he got up, and,
placing on his head a bag containing dry clothes, proceeded to the
river for his morning bath. He took the road to the eastern gate as he
had been ordered, but had not walked far when a friend invited him to a
<i>dv&acirc;da&#347;i</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e3350src" href=
"#xd26e3350" name="xd26e3350src">7</a> breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor old mother did not taste even a drop of water the
whole of the <i>&ecirc;k&acirc;da&#347;i,</i> (yesterday). Rice and hot
water for a bath are ready. Pour a little of the water over your
head,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3364src" href="#xd26e3364" name=
"xd26e3364src">8</a> pronounce one <i>g&acirc;yatr&icirc;</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3372src" href="#xd26e3372" name="xd26e3372src">9</a>
and taste a handful of rice. Whatever may be the urgency of your
business, oblige me for my poor mother&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spoke his friend, and P&acirc;pabh&icirc;ru, out of regard to
his father&rsquo;s order never to spurn a morning meal, ran in haste
into his friend&rsquo;s house to oblige him; the king&rsquo;s order all
the while sitting heavily on his mind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the minister was most anxious to hear the news of the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3379" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin&rsquo;s">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;&rsquo;s</span>
death, but was afraid to send any one to inquire about it, lest he
should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>arouse suspicion. So he went himself to the east
gate, as soon as the sun had risen, and asked the executioners, sitting
by the side of the caldron, by way of a simple question: &ldquo;Is the
business all done?&rdquo; And as they were instructed not to observe
who the person was that came to question them, but to tie him up and
boil him in the oil, they, notwithstanding his howls, bound him and
threw him in. As soon as he was dead, they extinguished the fire,
poured out the oil, turned over the caldron, corpse and all.</p>
<p>The Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; finished his <i>dv&acirc;da&#347;i</i>
breakfast, in great haste, and, with the betel leaf still in his hand,
ran to the gate to inquire of the persons seated by the caldron whether
it was all done. When he put them the question, they smilingly
replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir, it is all done. The minister is boiled to death. We
gave full execution to the king&rsquo;s orders. You may go and report
the affair to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, not knowing the reason for the course
events had taken, ran back and reported the reply of the executioners
to the king. The minister&rsquo;s interference in the affair at once
kindled suspicion in the king&rsquo;s mind. He unsheathed his scimitar,
and holding it in his right hand, twisted the lock of hair on the
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;&rsquo;s head into his left. He then asked him
whether he had not tried to get his wife <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>away from him the
previous morning, and told him that, if he concealed the truth, he
would make an end of him. The poor Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; now confessed
what he had seen, on which the king threw down the scimitar and fell
down on his knees before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words of thy benediction, O respected
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, have only now been explained to me. Thou hast sown
nothing but good; and good in having thy life preserved, hast thou
reaped. The wicked minister&mdash;whose conscious guilt made him so
very anxious to hear about thy death&mdash;because he sowed a bad
intention in his heart has reaped evil, even a death that he never
expected. Another victim of evil sowing, remains in my queen, in whom I
placed an undeserved love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So said he, and ordered her to the gallows. The old
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; he appointed his minister and reigned for a long
time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=

<h2 class="label">XVII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Light Makes Prosperity.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a Tamil proverb <i lang="ta-latn">d&icirc;pam
lakshm&icirc;karam</i>, meaning, &ldquo;light makes prosperity,&rdquo;
and the following story is related to explain it:&mdash;</p>
<p>In the town of G&ocirc;vindap&acirc;th&icirc; there lived a merchant
named Pa&#347;upati &#346;e&#7789;&#7789;i, who had a son and a
daughter. The son&rsquo;s name was Vin&icirc;ta and the
daughter&rsquo;s Garv&icirc;, and while still playmates they made a
mutual vow, that in case they ever had children that could be married
to each other, they would certainly see that this was done. Garv&icirc;
grew up to marry a very rich merchant, and gave birth in due course to
three daughters, the last of whom was named Sungu&#7751;&icirc;.
Vin&icirc;ta, too, had three sons. Before, however, this brother and
sister could fulfil their vow an event happened which threw a gloom
over all their expectations.</p>
<p>Pa&#347;upati &#346;e&#7789;&#7789;i died, and his
creditors&mdash;for he had many&mdash;grew troublesome. All his
property had to be sold to clear his debts, and in a month or two after
his father&rsquo;s death Vin&icirc;ta was reduced to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>condition of a penniless pauper. But being a
sensible person he patiently bore up against his calamity, and tried
his best to live an honest life on what little was left to him.</p>
<p>His sister Garv&icirc; was, as has been already said, married into a
rich family, and when she saw the penniless condition of her brother
the engagements she had entered into with him began to trouble her. To
give or not to give her daughters in marriage to the sons of her
brother! This was the question that occupied her thoughts for several
months, till at last she determined within herself never to give poor
husbands to her children. Fortunately for her, two young merchants of
respectable family offered themselves to her two eldest daughters, she
gladly accepted them and had the weddings celebrated. The last
daughter, Sugu&#7751;&icirc;, alone remained unmarried.</p>
<p>Vin&icirc;ta was sorely troubled in his heart at this
disappointment, as he never thought that his sister would thus look
down upon his poverty; but, being very sensible, he never interfered
and never said a word. The vow of his childhood was, however, known to
every one, and some came to sympathise with him; while others spoke in
a criticising tone to Garv&icirc; for having broken her promise,
because her brother had become poor through unforeseen circumstances.
Their remarks fell on the ears of Sugu&#7751;&icirc;, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>who
was as yet unmarried, and also was a very learned and sensible girl.
She found her uncle Vin&icirc;ta extremely courteous and respectful,
and his sons all persons of virtue and good nature. The thought that
her mother should have forgotten all these excellent and rare qualities
in the presence of fleeting mammon (<i>asthirai&#347;varya</i>) vexed
her heart very greatly. So, though it is considered most contrary to
etiquette for a girl in Hind&ucirc; society to fix upon a boy as her
husband, she approached her mother and thus addressed her:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, I have heard all the story about your vow to your
brother to marry us&mdash;myself and my sisters&mdash;to his sons, our
cousins; but I am ashamed to see you have unwarrantably broken it in
the case of my sisters. I cannot bear such shame. I cannot marry anyone
in the world except one of my three cousins. You must make up your mind
to give me your consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garv&icirc; was astonished to hear her youngest daughter talk thus
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to marry a beggar?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;We will
never agree to it, and if you persist we will give you away to your
penniless pauper, but we will never see your face again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sugu&#7751;&icirc; persisted. So her marriage with the youngest
son of Vin&icirc;ta was arranged. He had never spoken a word about it
to his sister, but he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href=
"#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>had waited to make matches for his
children till all his sister&rsquo;s daughters had been given away, and
when he heard that Sugu&#7751;&icirc; was determined to marry his
youngest son, he was very pleased. He soon fixed upon two girls from a
poor family for his other sons, and celebrated the three weddings as
became his position.</p>
<p>Sugu&#7751;&icirc; was as noble in her conduct as in her love for
her poor cousin. She was never proud or insolent on account of having
come from a rich family. Nor did she ever disregard her husband, or his
brothers, or father.</p>
<p>Now Vin&icirc;ta and his sons used to go out in the mornings to
gather dried leaves which his three daughters-in-law stitched into
plates (<i>patr&acirc;val&icirc;</i>), which the male members of the
family sold in the <i>b&acirc;z&acirc;r</i> for about four
<i>pa&#7751;ams</i> each.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3449src" href=
"#xd26e3449" name="xd26e3449src">1</a> Sometimes these leaf-plates
would go for more, sometimes for less; but whatever money the
father-in-law brought home his daughters-in-law used for the
day&rsquo;s expense. The youngest of them was Sugu&#7751;&icirc;, who
spent the money most judiciously, and fed her father-in-law and his
sons sumptuously. Whatever remained she partook of with her two poor
sisters-in-law, and lived most contentedly. And the family respected
Sugu&#7751;&icirc; as a paragon of virtue, and had a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>very
great regard for her. Her parents, as they had threatened, never
returned to see how their last, and of course once beloved, child was
doing in her husband&rsquo;s home. Thus passed a couple of years.</p>
<p>One day the king of the town was taking an oil bath, and pulling a
ring off his finger, left it in a niche in the open courtyard. A
<i>garu&#7693;a</i> (<span class="corr" id="xd26e3466" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hma&#7751;i">Br&acirc;hma&#7751;&icirc;</span> kite)
was at that moment describing circles in the air, and, mistaking the
glittering rubies in the ring for flesh, pounced upon it and flew away.
Finding it not to be flesh he dropped it in the house of
Sugu&#7751;&icirc;&rsquo;s husband. She happened to be alone working in
the courtyard, while her sisters-in-law and the others were in
different parts of the house. So she took up the sparkling ring and hid
it in her lap.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards she heard a proclamation made in the street that the
king had lost a valuable ring, and that any person who could trace it
and give it back to him should obtain a great reward.
Sugu&#7751;&icirc; called her husband and his brothers and thus
addressed them:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord and brothers, I have the king&rsquo;s ring. Exactly
at midday a <i>garu&#7693;a</i> dropped it in our courtyard and here it
is. We must all go to the king, and there, before you three, I shall
deliver up the ring, explaining how I got it. When his majesty desires
me to name my reward I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>shall do so, and beg of you never
to contradict or gainsay my desires, if they appear very humble in your
opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brothers agreed, and they all started for the palace. They had a
very great respect for Sugu&#7751;&icirc; and expected a good result
from this visit to the king.</p>
<p>The palace was reached, and the ring was given back to the king with
the explanation. His majesty was charmed at the modesty and
truthfulness of Sugu&#7751;&icirc;, and asked her to name her
reward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My most gracious sovereign! King of kings! Supreme lord! Only
a slight favour thy dog of a servant requests of your majesty. It is
this, that on a Friday night all the lights in the town be
extinguished, and not a lamp be lit even in the palace. Only the house
of thy dog of a servant must be lighted up with such lights as it can
afford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed, most modest lady. We grant your request, and we
permit you to have the privilege you desire this very next
Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyfully she bowed before his majesty, and returned with her husband
and the others to her house. She then pledged the last jewel she had by
her and procured some money.</p>
<p>Friday came. She fasted the whole day, and as soon as twilight
approached she called both the brothers of her husband, and thus
addressed them:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href=
"#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My brothers, I have made arrangements for lighting up our
house with one thousand lamps to-night. One of you, without ever
closing your eyes for a moment, must watch the front of our house and
the other the back. If a woman of a graceful appearance and of feminine
majesty wishes you to permit her to enter it, boldly tell her to swear
first never to go out again. If she solemnly agrees to this, then
permit her to come in. If in the same way any woman wishes to go out,
make a similar condition that she must swear never to return at any
time in her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Sugu&#7751;&icirc; said seemed ridiculous to the brothers; but
they allowed her to have her way, and waited to see patiently what
would take place.</p>
<p>The whole town was gloomy that night, except
Sugu&#7751;&icirc;&rsquo;s house; for, by order of his majesty, no
light was lit in any other house. The
<i>Ash&#7789;alakshm&icirc;s</i>&mdash;the Eight
Prosperities&mdash;entered the town that night and went house by house
into every street. All of them were dark, and the only house lit up was
Sugu&#7751;&icirc;&rsquo;s. They tried to enter it, but the brother at
the door stopped them and ordered them to take the oath. This they did,
and when he came to understand that these ladies were the Eight
Prosperities, he admired the sagacity of his brother&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>A <i>nimisha</i> after the eight ladies had gone in, there
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>came out of the house a hideous female and
requested permission to go, but the brother at the back would not
permit this unless she swore never to come back again. She solemnly
swore, and the next moment he came to know that she was
<i>M&ucirc;d&ecirc;v&icirc;</i>, or Adversity, the elder sister of
Prosperity.</p>
<p>For she said:&mdash;&ldquo;My sisters have come. I cannot stay here
for a minute longer. God bless you and your people. I swear by
everything sacred never to come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, unable to breathe there any longer, Adversity ran away.</p>
<p>When the morning dawned, the Prosperities had already taken up a
permanent abode with the family. The rice bag became filled. The money
chest overflowed with money. The pot contained milk. And thus plenty
began to reign in Sugu&#7751;&icirc;&rsquo;s house from that day. The
three brothers and her father-in-law were overjoyed at the way
Sugu&#7751;&icirc; had driven away their poverty for ever, and even
Sugu&#7751;&icirc;&rsquo;s parents did not feel it a disgrace to come
and beg their daughter&rsquo;s pardon. She nobly granted it and lived
with all the members of her family in prosperity for a long life.</p>
<p>It is a notion, therefore, among orthodox Hind&ucirc;s, that light
in the house brings prosperity, and darkness adversity.<a class=

<h2 class="main">Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; and the Eight Robbers.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was an ancient city named Kaivalyam, in the
P&acirc;n&#7693;iya country, and in that city there lived a dancing
girl named Muttum&ocirc;han&acirc;. She was an excellent gem of
womankind, for though born of the dancing-girls&rsquo; caste, she was a
very learned and pious woman, and never would she taste her food
without first going and worshipping in the temple of <span class="corr"
id="xd26e3533" title="Source: Siva">&#346;iva</span>. She moved in the
society of kings, ministers, and <span class="corr" id="xd26e3536"
title="Source: Br&acirc;hmins">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;s</span>, and never
mingled with low people, however rich they might be. She had a daughter
named Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;, whom she put to school with the sons of
kings, ministers and <span class="corr" id="xd26e3539" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmins">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;s</span>.
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; showed signs of very great intelligence, even
when she was beginning her alphabet, so that the master took the
greatest care with her tuition, and in less than four years she began
her lessons and became a great
<i>pa&#7751;&#7693;it&acirc;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3545src"
href="#xd26e3545" name="xd26e3545src">1</a> However, as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>she
was only a dancing-girl by birth, there was no objection to her
attending to her studies in open school till she attained to maturity,
and, accordingly, up to that age she attended the school and mastered
the four <i>V&ecirc;das</i> and <i>&#346;&acirc;stras</i> and the
sixty-four varieties of knowledge.</p>
<p>She then ceased to attend the school, and Muttum&ocirc;han&acirc;
said to her:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling daughter, for the last seven or eight years you
have been taking lessons under the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span>, your master, in the
various departments of knowledge, and you must now pay a large fee to
remunerate your master&rsquo;s labours in having taught you so much.
You are at liberty to take as much money as you please from my
hoard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying she handed over the key to her daughter, and
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;, delighted at her mother&rsquo;s sound advice,
filled up five baskets with five thousand <i>mohars</i> in each, and
setting them on the heads of five maid-servants, went to her
master&rsquo;s house with betel leaves, areca nut, flowers and
cocoanuts in a platter in her hand, to be presented along with the
money. The servants placed the baskets before the master and stood
outside the house, while Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; took the dish of
betel leaves, nuts, &amp;c., and humbly prostrated herself on the
ground before him. Then, rising up, she said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My most holy <i>gur&ucirc;</i> (master), great are the pains
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>your holiness undertook in instructing me, and
thus destroying the darkness of my ignorance. For the last eight years
I have been a regular student under your holiness, and all the branches
of knowledge hath your holiness taught me. Though what I offer might be
insufficient for the pains your holiness took in my case, still I
humbly request your holiness to accept what I have brought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus said she, and respectfully pushed the baskets of <i>mohars</i>
and the betel-nut platter towards the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span>. She expected to
hear benedictions from her tutor, but in that we shall see she was soon
disappointed.</p>
<p>Replied the wretched <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span>:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;, do you not know that I am
the tutor of the prince, the minister&rsquo;s son and several others of
great wealth in Kaivalyam? Of money I have more than enough. I do not
want a single <i>mohar</i> from you, but what I want is that you should
marry me.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3594src" href="#xd26e3594"
name="xd26e3594src">2</a></p>
<p>Thus spoke the shameless teacher, and
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;&rsquo;s face changed colour. She was horrified
to hear such a suggestion from one whom she had thought till then to be
an incarnation of perfection. But, still hoping to convince him of the
unjustness of the request, she said:&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My most holy master! The deep respect I entertain towards
your holy feet is such that, though your holiness&rsquo;s words are
plain, I am led to think that they are merely uttered to test my
character. Does not your holiness know the rules by which a preceptor
is to be regarded as a father, and that I thus stand in the
relationship of a daughter to your holiness? So kindly forget all that
your holiness has said, and accepting what I have brought in my humble
state, permit me to go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the wretched teacher never meant anything of the sort. He had
spoken in earnest, and his silence now and lascivious look at once
convinced the dancing-girl&rsquo;s daughter of what was passing in his
mind. So she quickly went out and told her servants to take back the
money.</p>
<p>At home Muttum&ocirc;han&acirc; was anxiously awaiting the return of
her daughter, and as soon as Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; came in without
the usual cheerfulness in her face, and without having given the
presents, her mother suspected that something had gone wrong, and
inquired of her daughter the cause of her gloom. She then related to
her mother the whole story of her interview with her old master.
Muttum&ocirc;han&acirc; was glad to find such a firm heart in her
daughter, and blessed her, saying that she would be wedded to a young
husband, and lead a chaste life, though <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>born of the
dancing-girls&rsquo; caste. The money she safely locked up in her
room.</p>
<p>Now, the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span>, in consequence of
his disappointment, was very angry with Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;, and,
that no young and wealthy gentleman might visit her house, he spread
reports that Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; was possessed of a demon
(<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;&icirc;chch&acirc;tti</i>). So no one approached
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3620" title=
"Source: Chandral&ecirc;kk&acirc;&rsquo;s">Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;&rsquo;s</span>
house to win her love, and her mother was much vexed. Her great wish
was that some respectable young man should secure her daughter&rsquo;s
affections, but the master&rsquo;s rumours stood in the way. And thus a
year passed, and the belief that a
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;&icirc;chch&acirc;tti</i> had possessed
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; gained firm ground.</p>
<p>After what seemed to these two to be a long period, a sage happened
to visit Muttum&ocirc;han&acirc;&rsquo;s house, and she related to him
all her daughter&rsquo;s story. He listened and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the belief that a demon has taken possession of your
daughter has taken firm hold of the citizens, it is but necessary now
that she should perform (<i>p&ucirc;j&acirc;</i>) worship to the
demon-king on the night of the new moon of this month in the
cremation-ground. Let her do this and she will be all right, for then
some worthy young man can secure her affections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying the sage went away, and his advice seemed to be reasonable
to the mother. She very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href=
"#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>well knew that no such demon had
possessed her daughter, but that it was all the master&rsquo;s idle
report. But still, to wipe away any evil notion in the minds of the
people she publicly proclaimed that her daughter would perform
<i>p&ucirc;j&acirc;</i> in the cremation-ground at midnight at the next
new moon.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3640src" href="#xd26e3640" name=
"xd26e3640src">3</a> Now, it is always the rule in such rites that the
person who is possessed should go alone to the cremation-ground, and,
accordingly, on the night of the next new moon,
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; went to the burning-ground with a basket
containing all the necessary things for worship, and a light.</p>
<p>Near Kaivalyam, at a distance of five <i>k&ocirc;s</i> from it, was
a great forest called <i>Kh&acirc;&#7751;&#7693;avam</i>. In it there
dwelt eight robbers, who used to commit the greatest havoc in the
country round. At the time that Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; proceeded to
the cremation-ground, these eight robbers also happened to go there to
conceal what they had stolen in the earlier <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>part
of that night. Then, being relieved of their burden, they determined to
go to some other place to plunder during the latter half of the night
also. When Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; heard the sound of footsteps at a
distance she feared something wrong, and, covering up her glittering
light by means of her empty basket, concealed herself in a hollow
place. The thieves came and looked round about them. They found nobody,
but, fearing that some one might be near, one of them took out an
instrument called <i>kannakk&ocirc;l</i>, and, whirling it round his
head, threw it towards the east. This <i>kannakk&ocirc;l</i> is the
instrument by which these robbers bore holes in walls and enter
buildings, and some robbers say they get it from a thunderbolt. During
a stormy day they make a large heap of cow-dung, into which a
thunderbolt falls and leaves a rod in the middle, which is so powerful
that it can bore even through stone walls without making any noise. It
has also the attribute of obeying its master&rsquo;s orders. So when
the chief of the eight robbers threw his <i>kannakk&ocirc;l</i> towards
the east, true to its nature, it fell into the hole in which
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; was hiding, and began to pierce her in the
back. As soon as she felt it, she dragged it out by both her hands
without making the slightest noise, and, throwing it under her feet,
stood firmly over it. The robbers, having concealed the eight boxes of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>wealth they had brought with them in the sands
near the cremation-ground, went away to spend the remaining part of the
night usefully in their own fashion.</p>
<p>As soon as the robbers had left the place Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;
came out, and, taking possession of the robbers&rsquo; rod, took out
the eight boxes that the robbers had buried. With these she quickly
hastened home, where her mother was awaiting her return. She soon made
her appearance, and related all that had occurred during the night to
her mother. They soon removed the contents of the boxes and locked them
up safely. Then, taking the empty boxes, she filled them up with
stones, old iron and other useless materials, and, arranging them two
and two by the side of each leg of her cot, went to sleep on it.</p>
<p>As the night was drawing to a close, the robbers, with still more
booty, came to the ground, and were thunderstruck when they missed
their boxes. But as the day was dawning they went away into the jungle,
leaving the investigation of the matter to the next night. They were
astonished at the trick that had been played upon them and were very
anxious to find out the thief who had outwitted thieves. Now they were
sure that their boring-rod, which they had aimed against the unknown
person who might be lurking in the <i>sma&#347;&acirc;nam</i>
(cremation-ground), must have wounded him. So one of them assumed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>the guise of an ointment-seller,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3674src" href="#xd26e3674" name="xd26e3674src">4</a>
and, with some ointment in a cocoanut-bottle, began to walk the streets
of Kaivalyam city, crying out:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ointment to sell. The best of ointments to cure new wounds
and old sores. Please buy my ointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the other seven thieves assumed seven different disguises and
also went wandering round the streets of the city. A maid-servant of
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; had seen that her mistress was suffering from
the effects of a wound in her back, and never suspecting a thief in the
medicine seller, called out to the ointment-man and took him inside the
house. She then informed Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; that she had brought
in an ointment-man, and that she would do well to buy a little of his
medicine for her wound. The clever Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; at once
recognised the thief in the medicine vendor, and he too, as he was a
very cunning brute, recognised in the young lady the thief of his
boxes, and found her wound to be that made by his boring-rod. They soon
parted company. The lady bought a little ointment, and the thief in
disguise, gladly giving a little of his precious stuff from his
cocoanut-bottle, went away. The eight thieves had appointed a place
outside Kaivalyam for their rendezvous, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>there they learnt who had robbed them of their
treasure. Not wishing to remain idle, they chose that very night both
to break into Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;&rsquo;s house and bring away
herself and their boxes.</p>
<p>Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;, too, was very careful. She locked up all
the treasures and kept the eight boxes filled with rubbish, so as to
correspond with their original weights, under the cot on which she
slept, or rather pretended to sleep, that night. The thieves in due
course made a hole into her bedroom and entered. They found her to all
appearance sound asleep, and to their still greater joy, they found
beneath her cot their eight boxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vixen is asleep. Let us come to-morrow night and take her
away; but first let us remove our boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying to each other, they took their boxes, each placing one on
his head, and returned in haste to their cave, which they reached early
in the morning. But when they opened the boxes to sort out their booty,
astonishment of astonishments, their eyes met only broken pieces of
stone, lumps of iron, and other such rubbish. Every one of them placed
his forefinger at right angles to the tip of his nose, and
exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! A very clever girl. She has managed to deceive us all.
But let this day pass. We shall see whether she will not fall into our
hands to-night.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href=
"#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus, in wonder and amazement, they spent the whole day. Nor was
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; idle at her own house. She was sure she would
again see the robbers in her room that night, and, in order to be
prepared for the occasion, she made a small sharp knife out of the
robber&rsquo;s rod, and kept it beneath her pillow, in the place where
she was accustomed to keep her purse containing a few betel leaves,
nuts, <i>chu&#7751;am</i>, &amp;c., to chew. The night came on. Early
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; had her supper and retired to bed. Sleep she
could not, but she cunningly kept eyelids closed and pretended to
sleep. Even before it was midnight the eight thieves broke into her
room, saying to themselves:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This clever lady-thief sleeps soundly. We will do her no
mischief here. Let us range ourselves two and two at each leg of her
cot, and carry her away unconscious to the woods. There we can kill
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus thinking, the eight thieves ranged themselves at the side of
the four legs of the cot, and, without the slightest shaking, removed
the cot with the sleeper on it outside the town. Their joy in thus
having brought away their enemy was very great, and, not fearing for
the safe custody of their prisoner, they marched to their cave.
Meanwhile Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; was not idle on the cot. The way to
the jungle was through a long and fine avenue of mango trees. It
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>was the mango season, and all the branches were
hanging with bunches of ripe and unripe fruit. To make up for her
weight on the cot she kept plucking mango bunches and heaping them on
it, and as soon as a quantity which she thought would make up her
weight was upon her cot, she without the slightest noise took hold of a
branch and swung herself off it. The thieves walked on as before, the
weight on their heads not apparently diminishing, leaving our heroine
safely seated on a mango branch to pass the few remaining
<i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</i> of that anxious night there. The thieves
reached their cave just at daybreak, and when they placed their burden
down their eyes met only bunches of ripe mangoes, and not the lady they
looked for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she a woman of flesh and blood, or is she a devil?&rdquo;
asked the chief of the next in rank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord! she is a woman fast enough, and if we search in the
wood we shall find her,&rdquo; replied he, and at once all the eight
robbers after a light breakfast began to search for her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the morning dawned upon Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; and let
her see that she was in the midst of a thick jungle. She feared to
escape in the daytime as the way was long, and she was sure that the
robbers would soon be after her. So she resolved to conceal herself in
some deep ambush and wait for the night. Before she left the cot for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>the mango branch she had secured in her hip the
small knife she had made for herself out of the robbers&rsquo; rod and
the purse containing the materials for chewing betel; and near the tree
into which she had climbed she saw a deep hollow surrounded by
impenetrable reeds on all sides. So she slowly let herself down from
the tree into this hollow, and anxiously waited there for the
night.</p>
<p>All this time the eight thieves were searching for her in different
places, and one of them came to the spot where Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;
had sat in the tree, and the dense bushes near made him suspect that
she was hidden there; so he proceeded to examine the place by climbing
up the tree. When Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; saw the thief on the tree
she gave up all hopes of life. But suddenly a bright thought came into
her mind, just as the man up above saw her. Putting on a most cheerful
countenance she slowly spoke to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear husband, for I must term you so from this moment,
since God has elevated you now to that position, do not raise an alarm.
Come down here gently, that we may be happy in each other&rsquo;s
company. You are my husband and I am your wife from this
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spoke the clever Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;, and the head of the
thief began to turn with joy when he heard so sweet a speech, and
forgetting all her previous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href=
"#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>conduct to himself and his
brethren, he leapt into the hollow. She welcomed him with a smiling
face, in which the eager heart of the robber read sincere affection,
and gave him some betel-nut to chew and chewed some herself merrily.
Now redness of the tongue after chewing betel is always an indication
of the mutual affection of a husband and wife among the illiterate of
Hindu society. So while the betel-leaf was being chewed she put out her
tongue to show the thief how red it was, letting him see thereby how
deeply she loved him: and he, to show in return how deeply he loved
her, put out his tongue too. And she, as if examining it closely,
clutched it in her left hand, while with her right hand in the
twinkling of an eye cut off the tongue and nose of the robber, and
taking advantage of the confusion that came over him she cut his throat
and left him dead.</p>
<p>By this time evening was fast approaching, and the other seven
robbers, after fruitless search, returned to their cave, feeling sure
that the eighth man must have discovered Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;. They
waited and waited the whole night, but no one returned, for how could a
man who had been killed come back?</p>
<p>Our heroine, meanwhile, as soon as evening set in started homewards,
being emboldened by the occasion and the circumstances in which she was
placed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>She reached home safely at midnight and related
all her adventures to her mother. Overcome by exhaustion she slept the
rest of the night, and as soon as morning dawned began to strengthen
the walls of her bedroom by iron plates. To her most useful
pocket-knife she now added a bagful of powdered chillies, and went to
bed, not to sleep, but to watch for the robbers. Just as she expected,
a small hole was bored in the east wall of her bedroom, and one of the
seven robbers thrust in his head. As soon as she saw the hole our
heroine stood by the side of it with the powder and knife, and with the
latter she cut off the nose of the man who peeped in and thrust the
powder into the wound. Unable to bear the burning pain he dragged
himself back, uttering &ldquo;<i>&#7749;a, &#7749;a, &#7749;a,
&#7749;a,</i>&rdquo; having now no nose to pronounce properly with. A
second thief, abusing the former for having lost his nose so
carelessly, went in, and the bold lady inside dealt in the same way
with his nose, and he too, dragged himself back in the same way,
calling out &ldquo;<i>&#7749;a, &#7749;a, &#7749;a,
&#7749;a.</i>&rdquo; A third thief abused the second in his turn, and
going in lost his nose also. Thus all the seven thieves lost their
noses, and, fearing to be discovered if they remained, ran off to the
forest, where they had to take a few days&rsquo; rest from their
plundering habits to cure their mutilated noses.</p>
<p>Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; had thus three or four times disappointed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>the thieves. The more she disappointed them the
more she feared for her own safety, especially as she had now inflicted
a life-long shame on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thieves will surely come as soon as their noses are cured
and kill me in some way or other. I am, after all, only a girl,&rdquo;
she thought to herself. So she went at once to the palace and reported
all her adventures with the eight robbers to the prince, who had been
her former class-mate. The prince was astonished at the bravery of
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;, and promised the next time the robbers came
to lend her his assistance. So every night a spy from the palace slept
in Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;&rsquo;s house to carry the news of the
arrival of the robbers to the prince, should they ever go there. But
the robbers were terribly afraid of approaching
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;&rsquo;s house, after they came to know that
she had a knife made out of the boring-rod. But they devised among
themselves a plan of inviting Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; to the forest
under the pretence of holding a <i>nautch</i>, and sent to her house a
servant for that purpose. The servant came, and, entering
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;&rsquo;s house, spoke thus to her:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady, whoever you may be, you have now a chance
of enriching yourself. I see plainly from the situation of your house
that you are one of the dancing-girls&rsquo; caste. My masters in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>forest have made a plan to give a <i>nautch</i>
to their relatives on the occasion of a wedding which is to take place
there the day after to-morrow. If you come there they will reward you
with a <i>kar&ocirc;&#7771;</i> of <i>mohars</i> for every
<i>nimisha</i> (minute) of your performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spoke the servant, and Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;, knowing that
the mission was from the thieves, agreed to perform the <i>nautch</i>,
and, asking the man to come and take her and her party the next morning
to the forest, sent him away.</p>
<p>In order to lose no time she went at once to the prince and told him
all about the <i>nautch</i>. Said she:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know very well that this is a scheme of the thieves to kill
me, but before they can do that we must try to kill them. A way
suggests itself to me in this wise. To make up a <i>nautch</i> party
more than seven persons are required. One must play the drum; a second
must sound the cymbals; a third must blow upon the
<i>n&acirc;gasvara</i> pipe, etc., etc. So I request you to give me
seven of your strongest men to accompany me disguised as men of my
party, and some of your troops must secretly lie in ambush in readiness
to take the robbers prisoners when a signal is given to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; spoke, and all her advice the prince
received with great admiration. He himself offered to follow her as her
drummer for the <i>nautch</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227"
href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>and he chose six of the
ablest commanders from his army, and asked them to disguise themselves
as fiddlers, pipers, etc., and he directed an army of a thousand men to
follow their footsteps at a distance of two
<i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s&rsquo;</i> march, and to lie in ambush near the
place where they were going to perform the <i>nautch</i>, ready for a
call. Thus everything was arranged and all were ready by the morning to
start from Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Before the third <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</i> of the morning was over,
the robbers&rsquo; servant came to conduct Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;
with her party to the forest, where the prince and six of his strongest
men disguised as her followers, were waiting for him.
Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; with all her followers accompanied him, but as
soon as she left her house a spy ran off to the army, which, as ordered
by the prince, began to follow her party at a distance of two
<i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</i>.</p>
<p>After travelling a long way Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; and her party
reached the <i>nautch</i> pavilion at about five
<i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</i> before sunset. All their hosts were without
their noses, and some still had their noses bandaged up. When they saw
that <span class="corr" id="xd26e3812" title=
"Source: Chandral&ecirc;k&acirc;&rsquo;s">Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;&rsquo;s</span>
followers had a fine and prepossessing appearance, even the hard hearts
of the robbers softened a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us have a look at her performance. She is now entirely in
our possession. Instead of murdering her now, we will witness her
performance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>for a <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</i>,&rdquo; said
the robbers to each other; and all with one voice said
&ldquo;agreed,&rdquo; and at once the order for the performance was
given.</p>
<p>Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;, who was clever in every department of
knowledge, began her performance, and, by the most exquisite movement
of her limbs, held the audience spell-bound, when suddenly <i>t&acirc;
tai, t&ocirc;m</i> clashed the cymbals. This was the signal for the
destruction of the robbers, as well as the sign of the close of a part
of the <i>nautch</i>. In the twinkling of an eye the seven disguised
followers of the dancing-girl had thrown down the thieves and were upon
them. Before the servants of the robbers could come to the help of
their masters the footsteps of an army near were heard, and in no time
the prince&rsquo;s one thousand men were on the spot and took all the
robbers and their followers prisoners.</p>
<p>So great had been the ravages of these robbers in and round
Kaivalyam that, without any mercy being shown to them, they and their
followers were all ordered to be beheaded, and the prince was so much
won over by the excellent qualities of Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc; that,
notwithstanding her birth as a dancing-girl, he regarded her as a gem
of womankind and married her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy a girl in a <i>b&acirc;z&acirc;r</i>&rdquo; (<i>kanniyai
ka&#7693;aiyir kol&#803;</i>) is a proverb. What matter where a girl is
born provided she is virtuous! And Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;, by her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>excellent virtue, won a prince for her lord. And
when that lord came to know of the real nature of his teacher, who was
also the teacher of Chandral&ecirc;kh&acirc;, he banished him from his
kingdom, as a merciful punishment, in consideration of his previous
services. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Dakshinad&ecirc;&#347;a there lived a
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; boy who from his childhood was given a very liberal
education in Sansk&#7771;it. He had read so much in philosophy that
before he reached the sixteenth year of his life he began to despise
the pleasures of the world. Everything which he saw was an illusion
(<i>mithy&acirc;</i>) to him. So he resolved to renounce the world and
to go to a forest, there to meet with some great sage, and pass his
days with him in peace and happiness.</p>
<p>Having thus made up his mind, he left his home one day without the
knowledge of his parents and travelled towards the <span class="corr"
id="xd26e3855" title=
"Source: Dan&#7693;ak&acirc;ranya">Dandak&acirc;ranya</span>. After
wandering for a long time in that impenetrable forest, and undergoing
all the miseries of a wood inhabited only by wild beasts, he reached
the banks of the Tu&#7749;gabhadr&acirc;. His sufferings in his
wanderings in a forest untrodden by human feet, his loneliness in the
midst of wild beasts, his fears whether after all he had not failed in
his search for consolation in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231"
href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>a preceptor to teach him the
higher branches of philosophy, came up one after another before his
mind. Dejected and weary, he cast his glance forward as far as it could
reach. Was it a reality or only imagination? He saw before him a lonely
cottage of leaves (<i>par&#7751;a&#347;&acirc;l&acirc;</i>). To a
lonely traveller even the appearance of shelter is welcome, so he
followed up his vision till it became a reality, and an aged hoary
Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;, full fourscore and more in years, welcomed our
young philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has brought you here, my child, to this lonely forest
thus alone?&rdquo; spoke in a sweet voice the hoary lord of the cottage
of leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thirst for knowledge, so that I may acquire the mastery
over the higher branches of philosophy,&rdquo; was the reply of our
young adventurer, whose name was Subrahmanya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down my child,&rdquo; said the old sage, much pleased
that in this Kaliyuga, which is one long epoch of sin, there was at
least one young lad who had forsaken his home for philosophy.</p>
<p>Having thus seen our hero safely relieved from falling a prey to the
tigers and lions of the Dandak&acirc;ranya, let us enquire into the
story of the old sage. In the good old days even of this Kaliyuga
learned people, after fully enjoying the world, retired to the forests,
with or without their wives, to pass the decline of life in solemn
solitude and contemplation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href=
"#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>When they went with their wives
they were said to undergo the <i>v&acirc;naprastha</i> stage of family
life.</p>
<p>The hoary sage of our story was undergoing <i>v&acirc;naprastha</i>,
for he was in the woods with his wife. His name while living was
J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi. He had built a neat
<i>par&#7751;a&#347;&acirc;l&acirc;</i><span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3883" title="Not in source">,</span> or cottage of leaves, on the
banks of the commingled waters of the Tu&#7749;g&acirc; and
Bhadr&acirc;, and here his days and nights were spent in meditation.
Though old in years he retained the full vigour of manhood, the result
of a well-spent youth. The life of his later years was most simple and
sinless.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Remote from man, with God he passed his
days;</p>
<p class="line">Prayer all his business, all his pleasures
praise.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The wood yielded him herbs, fruits, and roots, and the
river, proverbial<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3893src" href="#xd26e3893"
name="xd26e3893src">1</a> for its sweet waters, supplied him with
drink. He lived, in fact, as simply as the bard who sang:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;But from the mountain&rsquo;s grassy side</p>
<p class="line xd26e3913">A guiltless feast I bring;</p>
<p class="line">A bag with herbs and fruits supplied,</p>
<p class="line xd26e3913">And water from the spring.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">His faithful wife brought him these, while
J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi himself devoted his whole time to the
contemplation of God.</p>
<p>Such was J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi&mdash;the abode of all wise
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>people&mdash;to whom the boy-philosopher,
Subrahmanya, resorted. After questioning each other both were mightily
pleased at the fortune which had brought them together.
J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi was glad to impart his hard-earned knowledge
during his leisure moments to the young student, and Subrahmanya, with
that longing which made him renounce the city and take to the woods
eagerly swallowed and assimilated whatever was administered to him. He
relieved his mother&mdash;for as such he regarded his master&rsquo;s
wife&mdash;of all her troubles, and used, himself, to go out to bring
the fruits, herbs, and roots necessary for the repasts of the little
family. Thus passed five years, by which time our young friend had
become learned in the many branches of Aryan philosophy.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e3926" title=
"Source: J&ntilde;&acirc;nadidhi">J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi</span> had a
desire to visit the source of the Tu&#7749;gabhadr&acirc;, but his wife
was eight months advanced in her pregnancy. So he could not take her;
and to take care of her he had to leave behind his disciple,
Subrahmanya. Thus after commending the lady to Subrahmanya&rsquo;s
care, and leaving for female assistance another sage&rsquo;s wife, whom
he had brought from a distant forest, J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi went his
way.</p>
<p>Now, there is a strong belief among Hindus that Brahm&acirc;, the
great creator, writes on everyone&rsquo;s head at the time of his birth
his future fortunes in life. He is supposed to do this just at the
moment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>of birth. Of course, the great god when he
enters the room to discharge his onerous duty, is invisible to all
human eyes. But the eyes of Subrahmanya were not exactly human. The
supreme knowledge which J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi had imparted to him
made it easy for him to discern at once a person entering most
impolitely the room in which his master&rsquo;s wife had been
confined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let your reverence stop here,&rdquo; said the disciple
angrily though respectfully.</p>
<p>The great god shuddered, for he had been in the habit of entering
hourly innumerable buildings on his eternal rounds of duty, but never
till then had a human being perceived him and asked him to stop. His
wonder knew no measure, and as he stood bewildered the following
reprimand fell on his ears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoary Br&acirc;hmi&#7751; sage (for so Brahm&acirc;
appeared), it is unbecoming your age thus to enter the hut of my
master, unallowed by me, who am watching here. My teacher&rsquo;s wife
is ill. Stop!<span class="corr" id="xd26e3939" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Brahm&acirc; hastily&mdash;for the time of inscribing the future
fortune on the forehead of the baby to be born was fast
approaching&mdash;explained to Subrahmanya who he was and what had
brought him there. As soon as our young hero came to know the person
who stood before him he rose up, and, tying his upper cloth round his
hips as a mark of respect, went round the creator thrice, fell down
before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>Brahm&acirc;&rsquo;s most holy feet and begged
his pardon. Brahm&acirc; had not much time. He wanted to go in at once,
but our young friend would not leave the god until he explained what he
meant to write on the head of the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son!&rdquo; said Brahm&acirc;, &ldquo;I myself do not know
what my iron nail will write on the head of the child. When the child
is born I place the nail on its head, and the instrument writes the
fate of the baby in proportion to its good or bad acts in its former
life. To delay me is merely wrong. Let me go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Subrahmanya, &ldquo;your holiness must
inform me when your holiness goes out what has been written on the
child&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Brahm&acirc; and went in. After a moment
he returned, and our young hero at the door asked the god what his nail
had written.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child!&rdquo; said Brahm&acirc;, &ldquo;I will inform you
what it wrote; but if you disclose it to anyone your head will split
into a thousand pieces. The child is a male child. It has before it a
very hard life. A buffalo and a sack of grain will be its livelihood.
What is to be done. Perhaps it had not done any good acts in its former
life, and as the result of its sin it must undergo miseries
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Your supreme holiness, the father of this child is a
great sage! And is this the fate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236"
href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>reserved to the son of a
sage?&rdquo; wept the true disciple of the sage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I to do with the matter? The fruits of acts in a
former life must be undergone in the present life. But, remember, if
you should reveal this news to any one your head will split into a
thousand pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this Brahm&acirc; went away, leaving Subrahmanya
extremely pained to hear that the son of a great sage was to have a
hard life. He could not even open his lips on the subject, for if he
did his head would be split. In sorrow he passed some days, when
J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi returned from his pilgrimage and was delighted
to see his wife and the child doing well, and in the learned company of
the old sage our young disciple forgot all his sorrow.</p>
<p>Three more years passed away in deep study, and again the old sage
wanted to go on a pilgrimage to the sacred source of the
Tu&#7749;gabhadr&acirc;. Again was his wife expecting her confinement,
and he had to leave her and his disciple behind with the usual
temporary female assistance. Again, too, did Brahm&acirc; come at the
moment of birth, but found easy admittance as Subrahmanya had now
become acquainted with him owing to the previous event. Again did
Brahm&acirc; take an oath from him not to communicate the fortunes of
the second child, with the curse that if he broke his oath, his head
would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>split into a thousand pieces. This child was a
female, and the nail had written that her fate was to be that of a
frivolous woman. Extremely vexed was our young philosopher. The thought
vexed him to such a degree, that language has no words to express it.
After worrying a great deal he consoled himself with the soothing
philosophies of the fatalists, that fate alone governs the world.</p>
<p>The old sage in due course returned, and our young disciple spent
two more happy years with him. After a little more than ten years had
been thus spent the boy reached to five years and the girl to two. The
more they advanced in years the more did the recollection of their
future pain Subrahmanya. So one morning he humbly requested the old
sage to permit him to go on a long journey to the Him&acirc;layas and
other mountains, and J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi, knowing that all that he
knew had been grasped by the young disciple, permitted him with a glad
heart to satisfy his curiosity.</p>
<p>Our hero started, and after several years, during which he visited
several towns and learned men, reached the Him&acirc;layas. There he
saw many sages, and lived with them for some time. He did not remain in
one place, for his object was more to examine the world. So he went
from place to place, and after a long and interesting journey of twenty
years he again returned to the banks of the Tu&#7749;gabhadr&acirc;,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>at the very place where he lived for ten years
and imbibed philosophical knowledge from <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3973" title=
"Source: J&#7749;&acirc;nanidhi">J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi</span>. But he
saw there neither J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi nor his old wife. They had
long since fallen a prey to the lord of death. Much afflicted at heart
at seeing his master and mistress no more, he went to the nearest town,
and there after a deal of search he found a coolie with a single
buffalo. The fate which Brahm&acirc;&rsquo;s nail had written on his
master&rsquo;s son rushed into the mind of Subrahmanya. He approached
the coolie, and, on closely examining him from a distance, our hero
found distinct indications of his master&rsquo;s face in the labourer.
His grief knew no bounds at seeing the son of a great sage thus earning
his livelihood by minding a buffalo. He followed him to his home, and
found that he had a wife and two children. One sack of corn he had in
his house and no more, from which he took out a portion every day and
gave it to his wife to be shelled. The rice was cooked, and with the
petty earnings of a coolie, he and his family kept body and soul
together. Each time the corn in the sack became exhausted he used to be
able to save enough to replenish it again with corn. Thus did he
(according to the writing of Brahm&acirc;&rsquo;s nail) pass his days.
Kap&acirc;l&icirc; was the name of this coolie, the sage&rsquo;s
son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know me, Kap&acirc;l&icirc;?&rdquo; said our hero, as
he remembered his name. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href=
"#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span></p>
<p>The coolie was astonished to hear his name so readily pronounced by
one who was apparently a stranger to him, but he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry that I do not know you, Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subrahmanya then explained to him who he was, and requested him to
follow his advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do as I bid you. Early
morning <span class="corr" id="xd26e3988" title=
"Source: to morrow">to-morrow</span> leave your bed and take to the
market your buffalo and the corn sack. Dispose of them for whatever
amount they will fetch. Do not think twice about the matter. Buy all
that is necessary for a sumptuous meal from the sale proceeds and eat
it all up at once without reserving a morsel for the morrow. You will
get a great deal more than you can eat in a day; but do not reserve
any, even the smallest portion of it. Feed several other <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3991" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmins">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;s</span> with it. Do not
think that I advise you for your ruin. You will see in the end that
what your father&rsquo;s disciple tells you is for your own
prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, whatever the sage might say, Kap&acirc;l&icirc; could not
bring himself to believe him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do to feed my wife and children to-morrow if I
sell everything belonging to me to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus thought Kap&acirc;l&icirc;, and consulted his wife.</p>
<p>Now she was a very virtuous and intelligent woman. Said she:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=

<p>&ldquo;My dear lord, we have heard that your father was a great

ruin. Let us follow the sage&rsquo;s <span class="corr" id="xd26e4011"
title="Source: advise">advice</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When <span class="corr" id="xd26e4016" title=

thus supported the sage, he resolved to dispose of his beast and sack
the next morning, and he did so accordingly<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4019" title="Source: ,">.</span> The provisions he bought were
enough to feed fifty <span class="corr" id="xd26e4022" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmins">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;s</span> morning and
evening, as well as his own family. So that day he fed <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e4025" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmins">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;s</span> for the first time
in his life. Night came on, and after an adventurous day
Kap&acirc;l&icirc; retired to sleep, but sleep he could not. Meanwhile
Subrahmanya was sleeping on the bare verandah outside the house, and he
came to the sage and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy sage, nearly half the night is spent, and there are only
fifteen <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</i> more for the dawn. What shall I do
for the morrow for my hungry children? All that I had I have spent. I
have not even a morsel of cold rice for the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subrahmanya showed him some money that he had in his hand, enough to
buy a buffalo and a sack of corn in case the great god did not help
him, and asked him to spend that night, at <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4035" title="Source: lesat">least</span> the remainder of it, in
calm sleep. So Kap&acirc;l&icirc;, with his heart <span class="corr"
id="xd26e4038" title="Source: as">at</span> ease, retired to rest.</p>
<p>He had not slept more than ten <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</i> when he
dreamt that all his family&mdash;his wife and
children&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>were screaming for a mouthful of rice. Suddenly
he awoke and cursed his poverty which always made such thoughts dwell
uppermost in his mind. There were only five <i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</i>
for the lord of the day to make his appearance in the eastern horizon,
and before this could happen he wanted to finish his morning bath and
ablutions, and so he went to his garden to bathe at the well. The shed
for the buffalo was erected in the garden, and it had been his habit
daily before bathing to give fresh straw to his beast. That morning he
thought he would be spared that duty. But, wonder of wonders! He saw
another buffalo standing there. He cursed his poverty again which made
him imagine impossibilities. How could it be possible that his beast
should be standing there when he had sold it the previous morning? So
he went into the shed and found a real buffalo standing there. He could
not believe his eyes, and hastily brought a lamp from his house. It
was, however, a real buffalo, and beside it was a sack of corn! His
heart leapt with joy, and he ran out to tell his patron, Subrahmanya.
But when the latter heard it he said with a disgusted air:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Kap&acirc;l&icirc;, why do you care so much? Why do
you feel so overjoyed? Take the beast at once with the corn-sack and
sell them as you did yesterday.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span></p>
<p>Kap&acirc;l&icirc; at once obeyed the orders and changed the money
into provisions. Again fifty <span class="corr" id="xd26e4057" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmins">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;s</span> were fed the next
day too, and nothing was reserved for the third day&rsquo;s use. Thus
it went on in Kap&acirc;l&icirc;&rsquo;s house. Every morning he found
a buffalo and a sack of corn, which he sold and fed <span class="corr"
id="xd26e4060" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmins">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;s</span> with the proceeds.
In this way a month passed. Said Subrahmanya one day:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Kap&acirc;l&icirc;, I am your holy father&rsquo;s
disciple, and I would never advise you to do a thing prejudicial to
your welfare. When I came to know that you were the son of the great
sage, J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi, and were leading so wretched a life, I
came to see you in order to alleviate your miseries. I have now done
so, having pointed out the way to you to live comfortably. Daily must
you continue thus. Do as you have been doing for the past month, and
never store away anything, for if you reserve a portion all this
happiness may fail, and you will have to revert to your former wretched
life. I have done my duty towards you. If you become ambitious of
hoarding up money this good fortune may desert you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kap&acirc;l&icirc; agreed to follow the advice of the sage to the
uttermost detail and requested him to remain in his house. Again said
Subrahmanya:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son! I have better work before me than living in your
house. So please excuse me. But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243"
href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>before leaving you, I request
you to inform me as to where your sister is. She was a child of two
years of age when I saw her twenty years ago. She must be about
twenty-two or twenty-three now. Where is she?<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4071" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Tears trickled down the eyes of Kap&acirc;l&icirc; when his sister
was mentioned. Said he:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not, my patron, think of her. She is lost to the world. I
am ashamed to think of her. Why should we think of such a wretch at
this happy time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once the inscription made by Brahm&acirc;&rsquo;s nail rushed
into Subrahmanya&rsquo;s mind and he understood what was meant. Said
he:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind; be open and tell me where she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then her brother, Kap&acirc;l&icirc;, with his eyes still wet with
tears, said that his sister, the daughter of the sage <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e4084" title=
"Source: J&#7749;&acirc;nanidhi">J&ntilde;&acirc;nanidhi</span>, was
leading the worst of lives in an adjoining village, and that her name
was <span class="corr" id="xd26e4087" title=
"Source: Kaly&acirc;ni">Kaly&acirc;n&icirc;</span>.</p>
<p>Subrahmanya took leave of Kap&acirc;l&icirc; and his wife, after
blessing his little children and again warning his friend. He had
conferred what happiness he could upon his master&rsquo;s son, and now
the thought of reforming his master&rsquo;s daughter reigned supreme in
his heart. He went at once to the village indicated and reached it at
about nightfall. After an easy search he found her house and knocked at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>the door. The door was at once opened. But on
that day she was astonished to see a face such as she could never
expect to approach her house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know me, Kaly&acirc;n&icirc;?&rdquo; said Subrahmanya,
and she in reply said that she did not. He then explained who he was,
and when she came to know that it was a disciple of her father that was
standing before her she wept most bitterly. The thought that after
having been born of such a holy sage, she had adopted so wretched a
life, the most shameful in the world, made her miserable at heart. She
fell down at his feet and asked to be forgiven. She then explained to
him her extreme misery, and the hard necessity which had compelled her
to take to her present way of living. He then consoled her and spoke
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear daughter! My heart burns within me when I see that
necessity has driven you to this wretched life. But I can redeem you if
you will only follow my advice. From this night you had better shut
your door, and never open it to any other person except to him who
brings to you a large measure full of pearls of the first water. You
follow this advice for a day and I shall then advise you
further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being the daughter of a great sage, and having been compelled by
necessity to take to a wretched life, she readily consented to follow
her father&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245"
name="pb245">245</a>]</span>disciple when he promised to redeem her.
She bolted the door, and refused admission to anyone unless they
brought a large measure full of pearls. Her visitors, fancying that she
must have gone mad, went away. The night was almost drawing to a close
and all her friends had gone away disappointed. Who was there in the
village to give to her one measure full of pearls? But as the nail of
Brahm&acirc; had appointed for her such a life as stated, some one was
bound to comply with her terms. And as there was no human being who
could do so, the god Brahm&acirc; himself assumed the shape of a young
man, and, with a measure full of pearls, visited her in the last watch
of the night and remained with her.</p>
<p>When morning dawned he disappeared, and when Kaly&acirc;n&icirc;
explained to the disciple of her father the next morning that after all
one person had visited her with a measure full of pearls on the
previous night, he was glad to hear of it. He knew that his plan was
working well. Said he:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear daughter, you are restored to your former good self
hereafter from this day. There are very few people in this world who
could afford to give you a measure full of pearls every night. So he
that brought you the pearls last night must continue to do so every
night, and he shall be hereafter your only husband. No other person
must ever hereafter see your face, and you must obey my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>orders. You must sell all the pearls he brings
you every day and convert them into money. This money you should spend
in feeding the poor and other charities. None of it must you reserve
for the next day, neither must you entertain a desire to hoard up
money. The day you fail to follow my advice you will lose your husband,
and then you will have to fall back on your former wretched
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus said Subrahmanya, and Kaly&acirc;n&icirc; agreed to strictly
follow his injunctions. He then went to live under a tree opposite to
her house for a month to see whether his plan was working well, and
found it worked admirably.</p>
<p>Thus, after having conferred happiness, to the best of his
abilities, on the son and daughter of his former master, Subrahmanya
took leave of Kaly&acirc;n&icirc;, and with her permission, most
reluctantly given, he pursued his pilgrimage.</p>
<p>One moonlight night, after a long sleep, Subrahmanya rose up almost
at midnight, and hearing the crows crowing he mistook it for the dawn
and commenced his journey. He had not proceeded far, when on his way he
met a beautiful person coming towards him, with a sack of corn on his
head and a bundle of pearls tied up in the end of his upper cloth on
his shoulder, leading a buffalo before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, sir, walking thus in this forest?&rdquo; said
Subrahmanya. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span></p>
<p>When thus addressed, the person before him threw down the sack and
wept most bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, sir, my head is almost become bald by having to bear to
Kap&acirc;l&icirc;&rsquo;s house a sack of corn every night. This
buffalo I lead to Kap&acirc;l&icirc;&rsquo;s shed and this bundle of
pearls I take to Kaly&acirc;n&icirc;&rsquo;s house. My nail wrote their
fate on their respective heads and by your device I have to supply them
with what my nail wrote. When will you relieve me of these
troubles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus wept Brahm&acirc;, for it was no other personage. He was the
creator and protector of all beings, and when Subrahmanya had pointed
out the way for his master&rsquo;s children, and they had conquered
fate, Brahm&acirc; <span class="corr" id="xd26e4125" title=
"Source: toow as">too was</span> conquered. So the great god soon gave
them eternal felicity and relieved himself of his troubles.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Karn&acirc;ta d&ecirc;&#347;a there reigned a
famous king named Ch&acirc;mun&#7693;a, who was served by an household
priest, named <span class="corr" id="xd26e4138" title=
"Source: Gundappa">Gun&#7693;appa</span>, well versed in all the
rituals at which he officiated.</p>
<p>Ch&acirc;mun&#7693;a, one day, while chewing betel-leaves, thus
addressed <span class="corr" id="xd26e4143" title=
"Source: Gundappa">Gun&#7693;appa</span>, who was sitting opposite
him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My most holy priest, I am greatly pleased at your
faithfulness in the discharge of your sacred duties; and you may ask of
me now what you wish and I shall grant your request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest elated replied: &ldquo;I have always had a desire to
become the <i>Amild&acirc;r</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e4152src"
href="#xd26e4152" name="xd26e4152src">2</a> of a district and to
exercise power over a number of people; and if your Majesty should
grant me this I shall have attained my ambition.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said the king, and at that time the
<i>Amild&acirc;rship</i> of Na&ntilde;ja&#7749;g&ocirc;&#7693;
happening to be vacant, his Majesty at once appointed his priest to the
post, thinking that his priest, who was intelligent in his duties,
would do well in the new post. Before he sent him off, however, he gave
Gun&#7693;appa three bits of advice:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1). <i lang="ta-latn">Mukha kappage irab&ecirc;ku.</i></p>
<p>(2). <i lang="ta-latn">Ell&acirc;ru kevianna kachchi m&acirc;tan
&acirc;&#7693;u.</i></p>
<p>(3). <i lang="ta-latn">ell&acirc;r ju&#7789;&#7789;u kayyalii
irab&ecirc;ku.</i></p>
<p>The meaning of which is:</p>
<p>(1). You should always keep a black (<i>i.e.</i> frowning)
countenance.</p>
<p>(2). When you speak about State affairs you should do it biting the
ear (<i>i.e.</i> secretly&mdash;close to the ear).</p>
<p>(3.) The locks of every one should be in your hand (<i>i.e.</i> you
must use your influence and make every one subservient to you).</p>
<p>Gun&#7693;appa heard these words so kindly given by the king, and
the way in which he listened to them made his Majesty understand that
he had taken them to heart. So with a smiling face the king gave the
letter containing the appointment to <span class="corr" id="xd26e4196"
title="Source: Gundappa">Gun&#7693;appa</span>, who returned home with
an elated heart.</p>
<p>He told his wife about the change that had come over his prospects,
and wished to start at once to take charge of the new post. The king
and his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>officers at once sent messengers to <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e4203" title=
"Source: Na&ntilde;jang&ocirc;&#7693;">Na&ntilde;ja&#7749;g&ocirc;&#7693;</span>
informing the officers of the <i>Am&icirc;ld&acirc;r&icirc;</i> that a
newly appointed <i>Am&icirc;ld&acirc;r</i> would be coming soon. So
they all waited near the gate of the town to pay their respects to the
new <i>Am&icirc;ld&acirc;r</i> and escort him into it.</p>
<p>Gun&#7693;appa started the very next morning to
Na&ntilde;ja&#7749;g&ocirc;&#7693; with a bundle containing clean
clothes, six by twelve cubits long, on his head. Poor priest! Wherever
he saw the <i>ku&#347;a</i> grass on the road, he was drawn to it by
its freshness, and kept on storing it up all the way. The sacred grass
had become so dear to him, that, though he would have no occasion to
use it as <i>Am&icirc;ld&acirc;r</i> of
Na&ntilde;ja&#7749;g&ocirc;&#7693;, he could not pass by it without
gathering some of it. So with his bundle of clothes on his head and his
beloved <i>ku&#347;a</i> grass in his hands, Gun&#7693;appa approached
the city of <span class="corr" id="xd26e4226" title=
"Source: Na&ntilde;ja&#7749;g&ocirc;d">Na&ntilde;ja&#7749;g&ocirc;&#7693;</span>
about the twentieth <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e4230" title=
"Source: gha&#7789;ika">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</span></i> of the day.</p>
<p>Now, though it was very late in the day, none of the officers, who
had come out to receive the <i>Amild&acirc;r</i> had returned home to
their meals. Everyone was waiting in the gate and when Gun&#7693;appa
turned up, no one took him to be anything more than a priest. The
bundle on his head and the green ritual grass in his hands proclaimed
his vocation. But everyone thought that, as a priest was coming by the
very road the <i>Amild&acirc;r</i> would take, he might bring news of
him&mdash;whether he had halted on the road and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>would or might be expected before the evening.
So the next officer in rank to the <i>Amild&acirc;r</i> came to the
most reverend priest and asked him whether he had any news of the
coming <i>Amild&acirc;r</i>; on which our hero put down his bundle and
taking out the cover containing the order of his appointment with a
handful of <i>ku&#347;a</i> grass, lest his clothes be polluted if he
touched them with his bare hands informed his subordinate that he was
himself the <i>Amild&acirc;r</i>!</p>
<p>All those assembled were astonished to find such a wretched priest
appointed to so responsible a post, but when it was made known that
Gun&#7693;appa was the new <i>Amild&acirc;r</i> the customary music was
played and he was escorted in a manner due to his position, into the
town. He had been fasting from the morning, and a grand feast was
prepared for him in the house of the next senior official, which
Gun&#7693;appa entered for a dinner and rest. He there informed the
officials that he would be at the office at the twenty-fifth
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e4262" title=
"Source: gh&acirc;&#7789;ika">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</span></i> of the
evening. From the way in which he issued the order all thought that he
was really an able man, and that he had come in the guise of a simple
priest in order to find out the real state of his district. So every
officer went home, bathed, had his meal in haste and attended at the
office.</p>
<p>The chief assistant took the <i>Amild&acirc;r</i> to his house, and
entertained his guest as became his position. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>Gun&#7693;appa, being a priest, was a very good
eater, for never for a day in his life had he spent money out of his
own pocket on meals, so what reason had he to enquire about the price
of provisions? It was at the expense of others he had grown so fat! And
doing more than full justice to all the good things, much to the secret
amusement of his host and assistant, Gun&#7693;appa rose up from his
food, and washed his hands. He then wanted betel-leaves though to ask
for these before the host offers them is very impolite. But his
subordinate interpreted it as an order from a master and brought the
platter containing the necessary nutmeg, mace, nut, leaves, and
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e4273" title=
"Source: chunam">chu&#7751;am</span></i> (lime).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the dakshi&#7751;a?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4278src" href="#xd26e4278" name="xd26e4278src">3</a> next asked
the <i>Amild&acirc;r</i>. His host did not quite understand whether
this was meant in earnest or in joke, but before he could solve the
question in his mind:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the <i>dakshi&#7751;&acirc;</i>?&rdquo; reiterated
the <i>Amild&acirc;r</i>, and his assistant, thinking that his new
superior was prone to taking bribes, at once brought a bag containing
500 <i>mohars</i> and placed it in the platter. Now a
<i>dakshi&#7751;a</i> to a <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span> is not usually more
than a couple of rupees, but should an <i>Amild&acirc;r</i> ask for
one, his assistant would naturally mistake him, and think he was
hinting at a bribe! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253"
name="pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e4313" title=
"Source: Gundappa">Gun&#7693;appa</span> greatly pleased at a princely
<i>dakshi&#7751;a</i> such as he had never seen before in all his life,
at once opened the bag and counted out every gold piece in it,
carefully tying them up in his bundle. He then began to chew his betel,
and at one gulp swallowed up all the nutmeg and mace in the platter!
All this made his assistant strongly suspect the real nature of the new
<i>Amild&acirc;r</i>; but then there was the order of the king, and it
must be obeyed! Gun&#7693;appa next asked his assistant to go on in
advance of him to the office, saying that he would be there himself in
a <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e4323" title=
"Source: gha&#7789;ika">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</span></i>. The assistant
accordingly left a messenger to attend on the <i>Amild&acirc;r</i>, and
being very anxious to see things in good order, left his house for the
office.</p>
<p>Gun&#7693;appa now remembered the three bits of advice given by the
king, the first of which was that he should always put on, when in
office, a black countenance. Now he understood the word
&ldquo;black&rdquo; in its literal sense, and not in its allegorical
one of &ldquo;frowning,&rdquo; and, so going into the kitchen, he asked
for a lump of charcoal paste. When this was ready he blackened the
whole of his face with it, and covering his face with his
cloth&mdash;as he was ashamed to show it&mdash;entered the office. With
his face thus blackened and partly covered with a cloth, the new
<i>Amild&acirc;r</i> came and took his seat. Now and then he would
remove the cloth from his eyes to see <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>how his officers were
working, and meanwhile all the clerks and others present were laughing
in their sleeves at the queer conduct of their chief.</p>
<p>The evening was drawing to a close, and there were certain orders to
be signed: so taking them all in his hand the assistant approached the
<i>Amild&acirc;r</i>, and stood at a respectful distance. <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e4341" title="Source: Gundappa">Gun&#7693;appa</span>,
however, asked him to come nearer, and nearer the assistant came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still nearer,&rdquo; said <span class="corr" id="xd26e4346"
title="Source: Gundappa">Gun&#7693;appa</span>, and nearer still came
the assistant.</p>
<p>The second bit of advice from the king now rushed into the
<i>Amild&acirc;r&rsquo;s</i> mind that he should bite the ears of his
officials when he enquired into State affairs, and as <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e4354" title=
"Source: Gundappa&rsquo;s">Gun&#7693;appa&rsquo;s</span> want of sense
always made him take what was said literally, he opened his mouth and
bit the ear of his assistant, while in a muffled voice he asked him
whether all his people enjoyed full prosperity! The assistant, now in
very fear of his life, roared out that all the people were enjoying the
greatest prosperity. But <span class="corr" id="xd26e4357" title=
"Source: Gundappa">Gun&#7693;appa</span> would not let go his ear till
the poor assistant had roared out the answer more than twenty times.
The poor wretch&rsquo;s ear soon began to swell enormously, and leaving
the office in disgust, he started to report to the king the insane acts
of the new <i>Amild&acirc;r</i>.</p>
<p>Two out of the three bits of advice from the king had now been duly
obeyed, but the third, that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255"
href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>locks of all the people must
be in his hands, remained unfulfilled, and Gun&#7693;appa wished to
carry out that also quickly. Night had now set in, and as the
<i>Amild&acirc;r</i> still remained in his seat, all his officers were
compelled to do the same. In this way the tenth <i><span class="corr"
id="xd26e4371" title=
"Source: gha&#7789;ika">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</span></i> of the night
approached, and still the <i>Amild&acirc;r</i> would not get up, but
sat with his black face secured in his cloth, now and then peeping out
to see whether they were all asleep or awake. The fact was, he was
waiting for an opportunity to have all the locks of his officers in his
hand! As soon as all his officers fell asleep he intended to cut off
all their locks, as usual understanding the words in their literal
sense! At about midnight, never dreaming of the stupid act that the
<i>Amild&acirc;r</i> was contemplating in his mind, every one fell
asleep, and Gun&#7693;appa rose up, and with a pair of scissors cut off
all the locks of his officers. He then tied them all up in a bundle and
returned to his assistant&rsquo;s home late at night, where the
servants gave him something to eat; after which he started with his bag
of <i>mohars</i> and bundle of locks to his king to inform him of how
well he had obeyed his orders!</p>
<p>In the early morning he reached the presence of his Majesty only a
nimisha after his assistant had arrived. Seeing the
<i>Amild&acirc;r</i> he was too afraid to to lodge any complaint, but
his swollen ear drew the attention of every eye in the assembly.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span></p>
<p>Gun&#7693;appa now stood before the king with the charcoal on his
face and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most noble king, you ordered me to blacken my face for my new
duty. See, I have not even yet removed the dye! You ordered me next
only to speak while biting an ear. Look, please, at my
assistant&rsquo;s ear, who stands before you and tell me whether I have
not obeyed you!! And as for having the locks of my officers in my
hands; why here they are in this bundle!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never had the king seen a similar instance of such stupidity, and
the thought that Gun&#7693;appa had shorn so many respectable heads of
their locks, and had really bitten the ear of a worthy gentleman,
brought much shame to his heart. He begged pardon of the injured man
and from that day forward was very careful in the choice of his
officers! Poor Gun&#7693;appa was dismissed even from the priestship,
and his belly grew lean from having no longer the privilege of eating
rich food at others&rsquo; cost! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257"

<h2 class="main">The Gardener&rsquo;s Cunning Wife.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain village there lived with his wife a poor
gardener who cultivated greens in a small patch in the backyard of his
house. They were in thirty little beds, half of which he would water
every day. This occupied him from the fifth to the fifteenth
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e4405" title=
"Source: gha&#7789;ika">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</span></i>.</p>
<p>His wife used to cut a basketful of greens every evening, and he
took them in the mornings to sell in the village. The sale brought him
a measure or two of rice, and on this the family lived! If he could
manage any extra work of an evening he got a few coppers which served
to meet their other expenses.</p>
<p>Now in that village there was a temple to K&acirc;l&icirc;, before
which was a fine tank with a mango tree on its bank. The fish in the
tank and the mangoes from the tree were dedicated to the goddess, and
were strictly forbidden to the villagers. If any one was discovered
cutting a mango or catching a fish, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>he was at once
excommunicated from the village. So strict was the prohibition.</p>
<p>The gardener was returning home one morning after selling his greens
and passed the temple. The mangoes, so carefully guarded by religious
protection, were hanging on the tree in great numbers, and the
gardener&rsquo;s eyes fell on them! His mouth watered. He looked round
about him, and fortunately there was no one by, at least, as far as his
eyes could reach. So he hastily plucked one of the mangoes and with
nimble feet descended into the tank to wash it. Just then a most
charming shoal of fish met his eyes. These protected dwellers in the
tank had no notion of danger, and so were frolicking about at their
ease. The gardener looked about him first and finding no one by caught
half a dozen stout fish at one plunge of his hand. He hid them and the
mango underneath the rice in his basket and returned home, happy in the
thought that he had not been caught. Now he had a special delight in
fish, and when he reached his house he showed what he brought to his
wife and asked her to prepare a dish with the newly caught fish and the
never-till-then tasted mango.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had to water his garden, and went to the backyard for
the purpose. The watering was done by a <i>pik&ocirc;&#7789;a</i>. He
used to run up and down the pole while a friend of his, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>son of his neighbour, lifted the water and
irrigated the garden.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his wife cooked the dish of mango and fish in a pan, and
found the flavour so sweet that even while the fish was only half
cooked she began to taste one bit of it after another till more than
half had already gone down her throat! The dish was at last cooked, and
the few remaining slices in the pan were taken off the fire, so she
went into the verandah and from thence saw her husband running up and
down the <i>pik&ocirc;&#7789;a</i>. She beckoned to him that the dish
was ready and that he should come in and taste it. However, he never
noticed her, but kept on running up and down the
<i>pik&ocirc;&#7789;a</i>, and while running up and down he was obliged
to wave his hands about, and this his wife mistook as an indication
that she might eat up her portion of the dish. At any rate her
imagination made her think so; and she went in and ate a slice, and
then went out into the verandah again to call her husband who was still
running up and down the <i>pik&ocirc;&#7789;a</i>. Again, her husband,
so she thought, waved his hands in permission to go on with her dinner.
Again she went in and had another slice. Thus it went on for a full
<i>gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</i> till the last slice was consumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;With what great eagerness my
husband fetched the fish and the mango, and how sadly, out of
greediness, have I disappointed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260"
href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>him. Surely his anger will
know no bounds when he comes in. I must soon devise some means to save
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she brought the pan in which she cooked the fish and mango out of
the house and covered it with another pan of similar size and sat down
before it. Then she undid her hair and twisted it about her head until
it was dishevelled. She then began to make a great noise. This action
by a woman in an illiterate family of low caste is always supposed to
indicate a visitation from a goddess and a demon; so when her husband
from the <i>pik&ocirc;&#7789;a</i> tree saw the state of his wife, his
guilty conscience smote him. The change in his wife alarmed him, and he
came down suddenly and stood before her. As soon as she saw him she
roared out at him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you injured me to-day by plundering my mango and
fish? How dare you do such an irreligious act? You shall soon see the
results of your impertinence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goddess has come upon my wife most terribly,&rdquo;
thought the poor man. &ldquo;Her divine power may soon kill her! What
shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he fell at the feet of the divine visitation as he thought it to
be, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My most holy goddess, your dog of a servant has this day
deviated from the straight path. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261"
href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>Excuse him this time, and he
will never do so a second time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run then with the pan which contains the fruits of your
robbery and dip it deep into my tank. Then shall the fish become alive
and the mango shall take its place in the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gardener received the order most submissively, and taking the
pan in his hand flew to the tank. There he dipped it in the water and
came back to his house fully believing that his sin that day had been
forgiven, and that the cooked fish had become alive again and the mango
a living one. Thus did the cunning wife save herself from her
husband&rsquo;s wrath! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href=

<h2 class="label">XXII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Keep it for the Beggar.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When anything sweet is prepared in the house on a
particular night, and when the children, after feeding to their fill,
say to the mother:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amm&acirc;, this pudding is sweet; keep it for the
morning,&rdquo; the mother says at once:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me to keep it for the beggar, and I shall do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I not say keep it for the morning,
Amm&acirc;,&rdquo; ask the curious children, and the South Indian
mother gives to her listening children the following story:&mdash;</p>
<p>In a certain village there lived an affectionate husband and wife.
The husband would go to look after the fields and garden and return
home with abundance of vegetables. The wife would cook and serve her
lord to his fill. Before going out in the morning the husband used to
take whatever of last night&rsquo;s dishes were left cold to remain for
his breakfast.</p>
<p>The husband was a great eater of <i>dh&acirc;l</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4481src" href="#xd26e4481" name="xd26e4481src">1</a> soup.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>Every night the wife used to prepare a large
quantity of it and leave a good portion of it to stand for the
morning&rsquo;s breakfast of her lord. And he, too, owing to his taste
for the cold rice, used to warn his wife&mdash;though she was very
careful&mdash;and say:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep me some of this soup for the next morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife used to say: &ldquo;Yes, my dear husband, I shall do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This went on for several years. Every day the <i>dh&acirc;l</i> soup
was invariably prepared for the night meal and a good portion of it was
reserved for the cold rice. Every night, the husband, without
forgetting for even a single day, used to ask his wife to reserve a
portion. Thus passed on several years, as we have already said.</p>
<p>One night this husband had his supper. The wife had sat at her
husband&rsquo;s leaf to take her supper after her lord had had his.
That night, too, our hero, as usual, repeated:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep, my dear, some of this soup for the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once a gurgling laughter was heard near the doorsill of their
house. The pair were astonished, and searched their whole house. No one
was discovered. Again the husband said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep, my dear, some of this soup for the morning.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span></p>
<p>Again the laughter was heard. Finding that the laughter immediately
followed his order, the husband repeated it a third time. A third time
also the laughter broke out. They were astonished. Three times had
laughter been heard in their house, and still they could see no one.
Thinking that some one must have mocked him from the neighbouring
houses, he made careful inquiries and satisfied himself that none of
his neighbours had mocked him. He was afraid at the laughter which
thrice proceeded from a part of his house, as he had heard it
distinctly.</p>
<p>That very night our hero had a sudden and unforeseen calamity, and
just as he was dragging the latch of his backyard door a serpent stung
him in his finger. Neighbours hearing of the venomous reptile in their
next house, ran there with a stout cudgel. Already the master of the
house, who was passionately fond of the <i>dh&acirc;l</i> soup, had
swooned away. His wife was mourning by his side, saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear husband. How did you forget your soup so soon and
leave us all for the other world? Just now you gave me the order, and
before tasting it even you have died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The neighbours began to search for the snake; but they did not
succeed. And again a voice exclaimed from vacuum:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This husband&rsquo;s fate ended at the twelfth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span><i><span class="corr" id="xd26e4520" title=
"Source: gha&#7789;ika">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</span></i> of this night.
Yama ordered me to go and fetch him to his world. I came down and
reached this house at the eighth <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e4524"
title="Source: gha&#7789;ika">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;</span></i> when the
husband was giving the order to reserve for the morning meal his dear
<i>dh&acirc;l</i> soup. I could not contain my laughter, and so broke
out with a gurgling noise. As I am divine no one could perceive me. And
so none ever found me in this house after they heard the laughter. Then
I transformed myself into a serpent and waited for the hour to do my
death-dealing duty. The poor man is now no more. Four <i><span class=
"corr" id="xd26e4531" title=
"Source: gha&#7789;ikas">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</span></i> ago he was of
opinion that he would live and eat his cold rice to-morrow morning. How
very sanguine people are in this world of uncertainty. The cause for my
laughter was the husband&rsquo;s certainty when he issued that order to
reserve the <i>dh&acirc;l</i> soup for the breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus ended the messenger, and vanished of course to inform his
master how he had executed his orders.</p>
<p>And from that day, my children, it was fixed that our life in this
world is always uncertain, and that one who lives at this moment cannot
be sure of doing so at the next moment. While such is the case, how can
you say, &ldquo;Keep the pudding for to-morrow morning.&rdquo; Since
you saw in the story just related to you, that we can never be certain
of our life, you must say, instead of &ldquo;for to-morrow morning, for
the beggar.&rdquo; If we keep it for the beggar, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>and
if we fortunately live till to-morrow morning, we shall use a portion
of it and give the remainder to the beggar. Hence you must always,
hereafter, say when any supper from overnight is to be left for the
morning, &ldquo;Keep it for the beggar, Amm&acirc;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother. We shall do so hereafter,&rdquo; replied the
children.</p>
<p>In India, among <span class="corr" id="xd26e4548" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmins">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;s</span>, the wife must
never take her food before her lord, unless she is pregnant or sick. In
these two cases even on the days when it is possible to avoid the meal
before her lord, the wife <span class="corr" id="xd26e4551" title=
"Source: invaribly">invariably</span> does it; on other days she cannot
probably help it when she is physically unable. And in taking her meal,
the wife sits in front of the leaf (dish) from which her husband has
eaten. Most husbands generally leave their leaves clean, some out of
pure affection to their wives and out of a good intention of not
injuring the feelings of their wives. But there are others, who, as
they are unclean in their other habits, are also unclean in their
eating. The appearance of their leaves after they have left off eating,
is like those thrown out in the streets and mutilated by crows and
dogs. But their wives, cursing their lot to have married such husbands,
must, as long as they are orthodox, eat out of those leaves.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain town there lived a wealthy <span class=
"corr" title="Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span>. He
wished to build a house&mdash;pretty large and spacious&mdash;as became
his riches. For that purpose he called in a great number of
soothsayers, and fixed, guided by their scientific opinion, a place for
building the mansion. A certain portion of every day is supposed to be
bad for doing work. This portion is sometimes called the
<i>R&acirc;hu-k&acirc;l&#803;a</i>&mdash;the evil time of the demon
<i>r&acirc;hu</i> and sometimes <i>ty&acirc;jya</i>&mdash;the time to
be avoided. And abandoning carefully all these evil hours the wealthy
<span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span> built his mansion in
ten years. The first entrance into a new house to dwell is performed
always with a great deal of pomp and ceremony, even by the poor
according to their means. And our wealthy <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span> to please the gods
of the other world and the gods of this
world&mdash;<i>bh&ucirc;suras</i> <span class="corr" id="xd26e4585"
title="Source: Br&acirc;hmins">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;s</span>&mdash;spent
a great deal of his wealth, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268"
href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>with <i>veoras</i> and music
sounding all around him he entered into his house.</p>
<p>The whole of the day almost was spent in ceremonies and festivities.
All the guests left the place at evening, and much exhausted by the
exertions of the day the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span> house-owner retired
to rest. Before sleep could close his eyelids he heard a fearful voice
over his head exclaiming:&mdash;&ldquo;Shall I fall down? Shall I fall
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great was the concern of the landlord at hearing this voice. He
thought that some demon had taken possession of his house, and that he
was going to pull down the roof of his house over his own head. That
very night with as much haste as he entered the new house, he vacated
it and went back to his old house.</p>
<p><i>Sirukakha&#7789;ti perukav&acirc;l&#803;ka</i> is the Tamil
proverb. The meaning of it is &ldquo;build small and live great,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, build small houses without laying out much capital
uselessly in houses and live prosperously; and in villages many a rich
landlord would prefer small houses to big ones. The idea that he had
spent a great deal of money to build a big house troubled our hero. The
spaciousness of the house was one reason for the devil to come in so
easily, as he thought. When he vacated his house on the very night of
the day he entered it people began to talk all sorts of scandals about
it. The ladies in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>bathing places
(<i>gha&#7789;s</i>) in rivers began to give all sorts of colour to the
devils in that house. One said that when she was coming to the river
she saw a company of devils dancing round and round the middle pillar
of the upper storey of that unfortunate house. Another said that she
observed unearthly lights in that mansion the previous night. Thus
people talked and talked, furnishing new colours and new adventures out
of their pure imagination for a phenomena which they never saw. And our
unfortunate rich man had to lock up his house which he built after so
many days, and at the expense of so much money. Thus passed six
months.</p>
<p>In that town there lived a poor beggar <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span>. He was in extreme
poverty, and spent a great portion of the day in begging from house to
house his meal and clothes. He had, poor man, seven children. With this
large family he was constantly in the greatest misery. He had not a
proper house to live in. A miserable hut was all his wealth in that
village. Winter was approaching, and the roof of their only hut began
to fall down. The increasing miseries made the poor <span class="corr"
title="Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span> resolve upon
suicide. He could not bring himself to do that by his own hand. He had
heard of the haunted house, and resolved to go there with all his
family and perish by the hands of the devils. This was his secret
intention, but he never spoke of it <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>to any one. One day
he came to the rich <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span> who was the owner of
the haunted mansion, and spoke to him thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My noble lord! The winter is approaching and the roof of my
hut has fallen away. If you would kindly allow it I shall pass the
rainy days in your big house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the rich man heard this he was very glad to see that one person
at least there was in his little world who wanted the use of his house.
So, without hesitating any longer, he replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My most holy sir, you can have the free use of that whole
house for whatever time you may want it. It is enough if you light a
lamp there and live happily. I built it, and I am not destined to live
there. You can go and try your fortune there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So said the rich landlord, and gave the key of that haunted house to
the poor <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span>. The latter took it,
and with his family went and lived there from that day. That very night
he also heard the same voice: &ldquo;Shall I fall down?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shall I fall down?&rdquo; twice. Nothing daunted, and quite
resolved to perish with his wife and children, who were sound asleep
near him, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Fall down,&rdquo; and lo! a golden river
of <i>mohurs</i> and <i>pagodas</i> began to fall down in the middle of
the room from the top of the roof. It began falling and falling without
any stopping till the poor <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span>, who sat agape
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>with wonder, began to fear that they would all
be buried in <i>mohurs</i>. The moment he saw the sea of wealth before
him, his idea of suicide abandoned him. &ldquo;Stop please,&rdquo; said
he at once, and the <i>mohur</i>-fall came to a sudden stop. He was
delighted at the good nature of the devil, or whatever good spirit
might have taken possession of the house, for its having given him so
much wealth. He heaped up all the <i>mohurs</i> in one room, and locked
it up, and had the key of it in his own possession. His wife and
children got up during the <i>mohur</i>-fall. They also were informed
of everything. The poor <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span> advised his wife and
children to keep the matter secret, and they, to their great credit,
did so. They all&mdash;the poor parents and children&mdash;rejoiced at
the good fortune that had made its visit to them.</p>
<p>As soon as morning dawned the poor <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span> converted little by
little his <i>mohurs</i> into money and bought grains and clothes for
his family. This he did day by day till rumour began to spread that the
poor <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span> had found a
treasure-trove in the rich landlord&rsquo;s house. Of course this
rumour reached the ears of the wealthy man also. He came to the poor
<span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span> and asked him all
about the treasure-trove. The latter to his great honour related to the
landlord every bit of the <i>mohur</i>-fall. He also wished to witness
it and sleep in the room with the poor <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span>, for the first time
in his life, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>his thirst for <i>mohurs</i> inducing him to do
so. At about midnight &ldquo;Shall I fall down?&rdquo; was again
heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fall down&rdquo; said the poor <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span>, and lo! the
<i>mohurs</i> began to descend like a water-fall. But, horror of
horrors, they all appeared as so many scorpions to the house-owner. The
poor man was heaping up the gold coins, but all of them seemed to crawl
as so many scorpions to the eyes of the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop please,&rdquo; said the poor man, and the
<i>mohur</i>-fall stopped.</p>
<p>Then turning to the house-owner, the poor man said: &ldquo;My lord,
you may take home this heap for your use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house-owner began to weep and said: &ldquo;Most fortunate of
mankind, I have heard my old father often repeat a proverb, &lsquo;To
the fortunate fortune comes,&rsquo; and its meaning I have discovered
to-day only. I built the house and ran away when I heard the
&lsquo;shall I fall.&rsquo; No doubt I did very well, for had I
remained a scorpion torrent would have sent me to the other world. Know
then my most fortunate friend, that I see all your <i>mohurs</i> as so
many scorpions. I have not the fortune to see them as <i>mohurs</i>.
But you have that gift. So from this moment this house is yours.
Whatever you can convert into money of your <i>mohurs</i> I shall
receive and bless you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273"
href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>So saying the house-owner came out of the room fearing the
scorpions. And our poor man thus had all the fortune to himself, and
was no longer a poor man. He soon became one of the wealthiest of men
of his time, but remembering that he owed all his riches to the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e4719" title=

house, he used to share with the latter half of his wealth every
year.</p>
<p>This story explains the Tamil proverb <i>Madrish&#7789;am
ul&#803;l&#803;avanukku ki&#7693;aikkum</i>; to the fortunate good
fortune.</p>

<p class="first">There is a proverb in <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4739" title="Source: T&acirc;mil">Tamil&#804;</span> called
<i lang="ta-latn">Palikkuppali v&acirc;&#7749;gukiradu</i> which would
best be translated by the expression &ldquo;tit for tat,&rdquo; and the
following story I heard when a boy from my step-mother, illustrating
that proverb, and I have of late found the same story also in the
Trichinopoly districts.</p>
<p>In a certain village there lived a poor &#346;&ucirc;dra. He had
made a vow to the goddess of his village, that if he came out
successfully in a certain undertaking he would offer her a couple of
goats. And he succeeded in his undertaking, and thought that his
goddess alone had granted his request. Great was his joy and greater
became his faith in her extraordinary powers. And as he promised he
brought two fat goats and sacrificed them to her.</p>
<p>These goats thus sacrificed and the &#346;&ucirc;dra sacrificer who
meanwhile had died by a sudden fever, after a short time were all
re-born in the world to undergo the results of their goodness or sin.
The two goats, because they were sacrificed to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>goddess, were re-born as the king and the
minister of a large country. The &#346;&ucirc;dra, as he had as much
faith in his former life as in his goddess, was reborn in the
priest&rsquo;s (<i>gurukkula</i>) caste, of course neither the king and
his minister nor the priest had any reason to know their former life,
until the death of the latter approached, as we shall presently see. A
large kingdom fell to the share of the king, and he with his minister
reigned over it most peacefully. In an unfrequented wilderness was a
famous temple of a powerful goddess of of that country, and in that
pagoda the priest regularly conducted her worship.</p>
<p>Thus passed several years, the king and minister happy in their own
kingdom, and the priest executing his religious duties in the
wilderness. The priest was leading a most calm and holy life, eating
what grew in the wilderness. His life was as pure as pure can be.</p>
<p>But for all that fate would not forgive him for his acts in his
former life.</p>
<p>The king and the minister had vowed to the goddess of the wilderness
that if they returned successfully from the conquest of an enemy of
theirs they would offer her some human sacrifice. And so they returned,
and to make entire their vow to the goddess they left their kingdom
like ordinary men and came to the wood. All along the way they searched
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>for a person to sacrifice, but no
one&mdash;fortunately for him&mdash;was to be found. They still thought
that the vow must not be left unaccomplished, and resolved upon
catching the priest of the temple and offering him up as their intended
sacrifice. When such strong people like the king and his minister
resolved to do so, what could the poor priest do? He was quite unable
to escape when those two informed him of what they were going to do
with him on his entering to worship the goddess. Said the
priest:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sirs! You have come here resolved upon offering me up as a
sacrifice to the goddess. I cannot hereafter escape your hold. But if
you would allow me to perform my <i>p&ucirc;j&acirc;</i> to the goddess
this morning also, I shall gladly die after having done my
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So said the priest, and the king and the minister watched at the
entrance and let him in.</p>
<p>The priest went into the <i>Garbhag&#7771;iha</i>&mdash;the holy of
the holies in the temple, and performed his worship to the goddess.
After that was over he gave the image a severe blow on its back and
thus addressed it:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most merciless goddess. What have you done for all my faith
in you. In this lonely wilderness, without knowing any other duty than
your worship, I had been your true servant for the past many years. And
in reward for all that, I must fall now a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>prey to the sacrifice
of the king and the minister who are sharpening their knives outside to
cut off my head at this moment. Is this the result of all my
<i>p&ucirc;j&acirc;</i> (worship) to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake the priest, and the goddess, laughing, thus replied from
the vacuum:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My true priest. Your acts in your former life must trouble
you in this. And the charitable acts of this life, even, cannot protect
you in your next birth. In your former birth you had murdered two
goats. They were born as king and minister, and have dragged you here
to murder you. But this&mdash;the murder you are to undergo soon, by
these hands will relieve you only of one of the two murders of your
former life. And for the other murder you and they would be re-born
again, and again they would kill you. So in your next third life from
this one you would enjoy the fruits of all this devotion. Since now you
know the story of your former life, you will forgive me, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spoke the goddess, and the priest, as the knowledge of his
former life dawned upon him, by the grace of the goddess, seemed
resolved to die, in order to pay for his former sin. But the idea that
in the next life he was to undergo the same punishment, vexed him much,
and falling down at the goddess&rsquo;s feet, he respectfully requested
her to try her best to let him off the next life; and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>goddess&rsquo;s heart was also moved at the
severity of fate which would make her devotee pass through one more
life in misery before he enjoyed the fruits of his devotion. So she
devised the following plan to exculpate him from his two crimes at the
same time, and thus replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Priest! &lsquo;Intelligence can conquer even Fate,&rsquo; is
the proverb. When <i>K&acirc;li</i> gave 500 years&rsquo; life to
Vikram&acirc;ditya in his town, Bhatti, his minister, by making the
king live six months in his capital and six months in the jungle, made
his master&rsquo;s life to last for 1000 years. So by intelligence we
conquer our fate too, sometimes. So hear my advice. Ask the king who
has come to murder you to hold one end of the knife, and request his
minister to hold the other end. Ask both of them to aim the blow at
your neck; that will accomplish everything complete during this life.
They will have no revenge to take from you in your next
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the voice of the goddess stopped. The priest came back
with a cheerful heart to the king and the minister, and asked them to
oblige him by each of them holding one end of the knife and murdering
him. They agreed, and performed thus their vow<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4797" title="Not in source">.</span> The poor priest, too,
without having another miserable life, was born a king in his next
life, and lived in prosperity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279"
href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span></p>
<p>Here the story ends, and the story-teller in the Hind&ucirc;
household, and in my case my stepmother, would at once moralise, that
if we did anything to any one in this life, that one would pay us out
for it in our next life.</p>

purely Hind&ucirc; moral. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href=

<h2 class="main">The Beggar and the Five Muffins.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain village there lived a poor beggar and his
wife. The man used to go out every morning with a clean vessel in his
hand, return home with rice enough for the day&rsquo;s meal, and thus
they lived on in extreme poverty.</p>
<p>One day a poor M&aacute;dhava <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Br&acirc;hmin">Br&acirc;hmi&#7751;</span> invited the pair to
a feast, and among M&aacute;dhavas muffins (<i>t&ocirc;&#347;ai</i>)
are always a part of the good things on festive occasions. So during
the feast the beggar and his wife had their fill of muffins. They were
so pleased with them, that the woman was extremely anxious to prepare
some muffins in her own house, and began to save a little rice every
day from what her husband brought her for the purpose. When enough had
been thus collected she begged a poor neighbour&rsquo;s wife to give
her a little black pulse which the latter&mdash;praised be her
charity&mdash;readily did. The faces of the beggar and his wife
literally glowed with joy that day, for were they not to taste the
long-desired muffins for a second time? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>The woman soon turned the rice she had been saving, and the black
pulse she had obtained from her neighbour into a paste, and mixing it
well with a little salt, green chillies, coriander seed and curds, set
it in a pan on the fire; and with her mouth watering all the while,
prepared five muffins! By the time her husband had returned from his
collection of alms, she was just turning out of the pan the fifth
muffin! And when she placed the whole five muffins before him his
mouth, too, began to water. He kept two for himself and two he placed
before his wife, but what was to be done with the fifth? He did not
understand the way out of this difficulty. That half and half made one,
and that each could take two and a half muffins was a question too hard
for him <span class="corr" id="xd26e4824" title="Source: too">to</span>
solve. The beloved muffins must not be torn in pieces; so he said to
his wife that either he or she must take the remaining one. But how
were they to decide which should be the lucky one?</p>
<p>Proposed the husband:&mdash;&ldquo;Let us both shut our eyes and
stretch ourselves as if in sleep, each on a verandah on either side the
kitchen. Whoever opens an eye and speaks first gets only two muffins;
and the other gets three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So great was the desire of each to get the three muffins, that they
both abided by the agreement, and the woman, though her mouth watered
for the muffins, resolved to go through the ordeal. She <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>placed the five cakes in a pan and covered it
over with another pan. She then carefully bolted the door inside and
asking her husband to go into the east verandah, she lay down in the
west one. Sleep she had none, and with closed eyes kept guard over her
husband: for if he spoke first he would have only two muffins, and the
other three would come to her share. Equally watchful was her husband
over her.</p>
<p>Thus passed one whole day&mdash;two&mdash;three! The house was never
opened! No beggar came to receive the morning dole. The whole village
began to enquire after the missing beggar. What had become of him? What
had become of his wife?</p>
<p>&ldquo;See whether his house is locked on the outside and whether he
has left us to go to some other village,&rdquo; spoke the
greyheads.</p>
<p>So the village watchman came and tried to push the door open, but it
would not open!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;it is locked on the inside!
Some great calamity must have happened. Perhaps thieves have entered
the house, and after plundering their property, murdered the
inmates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what property is a beggar likely to have?&rdquo; thought
the village assembly, and not liking to waste time in idle
speculations, they sent two watchmen to climb the roof and open the
latch from the inside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the whole village, men, women, and children, stood outside
the beggar&rsquo;s house to see what <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>had taken place
inside. The watchmen jumped into the house, and to their horror found
the beggar and his wife stretched on opposite verandahs like two
corpses. They opened the door, and the whole village rushed in. They,
too, saw the beggar and his wife lying so still that they thought them
to be dead. And though the beggar pair had heard everything that passed
around them, neither would open an eye or speak. For whoever did it
first would get only two muffins!</p>
<p>At the public expense of the village two green litters of bamboo and
cocoanut leaves were prepared on which to remove the unfortunate pair
to the cremation ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How loving they must have been to have died together like
this!&rdquo; said some greybeards of the village.</p>
<p>In time the cremation ground was reached, and village watchmen had
collected a score of dried cowdung cakes and a bundle of firewood from
each house, for the funeral pyre. From these charitable contributions
<i>two</i> pyres had been prepared, one for the man and one for the
woman. The pyre was then lighted, and when the fire approached his leg,
the man thought it time to give up the ordeal and to be satisfied with
only two muffins! So while the villagers were still continuing the
funeral rites, they suddenly heard a voice:&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be satisfied with two muffins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately another voice replied from the woman&rsquo;s
pyre:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have gained the day; let me have the three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The villagers were amazed and ran away. One bold man alone stood
face to face with the supposed dead husband and wife. He was a bold
man, indeed for when a dead man or a man supposed to have died comes to
life, village people consider him to be a ghost. However, this bold
villager questioned the beggars until he came to know their story. He
then went after the runaways and related to them the whole story of the
five muffins to their great amazement.</p>
<p>But what was to be done to the people who had thus voluntarily faced
death out of love for muffins. Persons who had ascended the green
litter and slept on the funeral pyre could never come back to the
village! If they did the whole village would perish. So the elders
built a small hut in a deserted meadow outside the village and made the
beggar and his wife live there.</p>
<p>Ever after that memorable day our hero and his wife were called the
muffin beggar, and the muffin beggar&rsquo;s wife, and many old ladies
and young children from the village use to bring them muffins in the
morning and evening, out of pity for them, for had they not loved
muffin so much that they underwent death in life? <span class=

<h2 class="label">XXVI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Brahmar&acirc;kshas and the Hair.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain village there lived a very rich landlord,
who owned several villages, but was such a great miser that no tenant
would willingly cultivate his lands, and those he had gave him not a
little trouble. He was indeed so vexed with them that he left all his
lands untilled, and his tanks and irrigation channels dried up. All
this, of course, made him poorer and poorer day by day. Nevertheless he
never liked the idea of freely opening his purse to his tenants and
obtaining their good will.</p>
<p>While he was in this frame of mind a learned <i>Sany&acirc;si</i>
paid him a visit, and on his representing his case to him, he
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear son,&mdash;I know an incantation (<i>mantra</i>) in
which I can instruct you. If you repeat it for three months day and
night, a Brahmar&acirc;kshas will appear before you on the first day of
the fourth month. Make him your servant, and then you can set at naught
all your petty troubles with your <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286"
href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>tenants. The
Brahmar&acirc;kshas will obey all your orders, and you will find him
equal to one hundred servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero fell at his feet and begged to be instructed at once. The
sage then sat facing the east and his disciple the landlord facing the
west, and in this position formal instruction was given, after which
the <i>Sany&acirc;si</i> went his way.</p>
<p>The landlord, mightily pleased at what he had learnt, went on
practising the incantation, till, on the first day of the fourth month,
the great Brahmar&acirc;kshas stood before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, sir, from my hands?&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;what is the object of your having propitiated me for these three
months?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord was thunderstruck at the huge monster who now stood
before him and still more so at his terrible voice, but nevertheless he
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to become my servant and obey all my
commands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; answered the Brahmar&acirc;kshas in a very
mild tone, for it was his duty to leave off his impertinent ways when
any one who had performed the required penance wanted him to become his
servant; &ldquo;Agreed. But you must always give me work to do; when
one job is finished you must at once give me a second, and so on. If
you fail I shall kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord, thinking that he would have work <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>for
several such Brahmar&acirc;kshasas, was pleased to see that his
demoniacal servant was so eager to help him. He at once took him to a
big tank which had been dried up for several years, and pointing it out
spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see this big tank; you must make it as deep as the height
of two palmyra trees and repair the embankment wherever it is
broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my master, your orders shall be obeyed,&rdquo; humbly
replied the servant and fell to work.</p>
<p>The landlord, thinking that it would take several months, if not
years, to do the work in the tank, for it was two <i>kos</i> long and
one <i>kos</i> broad, returned delighted to his home, where his people
were awaiting him with a sumptuous dinner. When enemies were
approaching the Brahmar&acirc;kshas came to inform his master that he
had finished his work in the tank. He was indeed astonished and feared
for his own life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! finished the work in one day which I thought would
occupy him for months and years; if he goes on at this rate, how shall
I keep him employed. And when I cannot find it for him he will kill
me!&rdquo; Thus he thought and began to weep; his wife wiped the tears
that ran down his face, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest husband, you must not lose courage. Get out of the
Brahmar&acirc;kshas all the work you can <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb288" href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>and then let me know.
I&rsquo;ll give him something that will keep him engaged for a very
very long time, and then he&rsquo;ll trouble us no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her husband only thought her words to be meaningless and
followed the Brahmar&acirc;kshas to see what he had done. Sure enough
the thing was as complete as could be, so he asked him to plough
<i>all</i> his lands, which extended over twenty villages! This was
done in two <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e4934" title=
"Source: gha&#7789;ikas">gha&#7789;ik&acirc;s</span></i>! He next made
him dig and cultivate <i>all</i> his garden lands. This was done in the
twinkling of an eye! The landlord now grew hopeless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What more work have you for me?&rdquo; roared the
Brahmar&acirc;kshas, as he found that his master had nothing for him to
do, and that the time for his eating him up was approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my wife says she has a
little job to give you; do it please now. I think that that is the last
thing I can give you to do, and after it in obedience to the conditions
under which you took service with me, I must become your
prey!<span class="corr" id="xd26e4944" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>At this moment his wife came to them, holding in her left hand a
long hair, which she had just pulled out from her head, and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Brahmar&acirc;kshas, I have only a very light job for
you. Take this hair, and when you have made it straight, bring it back
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Brahmar&acirc;kshas calmly took it, and sat in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span><i>p&icirc;pal</i> tree to make it straight. He
rolled it several times on his thigh and lifted it up to see if it
became straight; but no, it would still bend! Just then it occurred to
him that goldsmiths, when they want to make their metal wires straight,
have them heated in fire; so he went to a fire and placed the hair over
it, and of course it frizzled up with a nasty smell! He was
horrified!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will my master&rsquo;s wife say if I do not produce the
hair she gave me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he became mightily afraid, and ran away.</p>
<p>This story is told to explain the modern custom of nailing a handful
of hair to a tree in which devils are supposed to dwell, to drive them
away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Few stories are more familiar and widely spread than
that of the Lost Camel, which occurs in the opening of the romance. It
was formerly, and perhaps is still, reproduced in English school
reading-books. Voltaire, in chapter iii. of his &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Zadig; ou, La Destin&eacute;e</span>&rdquo; (the materials of
which he is said to have derived from Geuelette&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Soir&eacute;es Bretonnes</span>,&rdquo;) has a
version in which a lost palfrey and a she dog are described by the
&ldquo;sage&rdquo; from the traces they had left on the path over which
they passed. The great Arabian historian and traveller Mas&rsquo;udi,
in his &ldquo;Meadows of Gold, and Mines of Gems,&rdquo; written A.D.
943, gives the story of the Lost Camel, and from Mas&rsquo;udi it was
probably taken into the MS. text of the &ldquo;Thousand and One
Nights,&rdquo; procured in the East (?Constantinople) by Wortley
Montague, and now preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4980src" href="#xd26e4980" name="xd26e4980src">1</a>
In that MS. it forms an incident in the story of the Sultan of Yeman
and his Three Sons: the princes, after their father&rsquo;s death,
quarrel over the succession to the throne, and at length agree to lay
their respective claims before one of the tributary princes. On the
road one of them remarks, &ldquo;A camel has lately passed this way
loaded with grain on one side, and with sweetmeats <span class="corr"
id="xd26e4983" title="Source: on on">on</span> the other.&rdquo; The
second observes, &ldquo;and the camel is blind of one eye.&rdquo; The
third adds, &ldquo;and it has lost its tail.&rdquo; The owner comes up,
and on hearing their description of his beast, forces them to go before
the king of the country, to whom they explain how they discovered the
defects of the camel and its lading. In a Persian work, entitled
&ldquo;Nigaristan,&rdquo; three brothers rightly conjecture in like
manner that a camel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291"
name="pb291">291</a>]</span>which had passed, and which they had not
seen, was blind of an eye, wanted a tooth, was lame, and laden with oil
on the one side, and honey on the other. The story is also found in the
Hebrew Talmud. Two slaves are overheard by their master conversing
about a camel that had gone before them along the road. It was blind of
an eye, and laden with two skin bottles, one of which contained wine,
the other oil. In a Siberian version (Radloff), three youths are met by
a man who asks them if they had seen his camel, to which they reply by
describing the colour and defects of the animal so exactly that he
accuses them to the Prince of having stolen it. &ldquo;I have lost a
camel, my lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and when I met these three young
men we saluted, and I told them that I had lost my camel. Quoth one of
these youths, &lsquo;Was thy camel of a light colour?&rsquo; The second
asked, &lsquo;was thy camel lame?&rsquo; And the third, &lsquo;Was it
not blind of an eye?&rsquo; I answered Yes to their questions. Now
decide, my lord. It is evident these young men have stolen my
camel.&rdquo; Then the Prince asked the eldest, &ldquo;How did you know
that the camel was of a light colour?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;By some
hairs which has fallen on the ground when it had rubbed itself against
trees.&rdquo; The two others gave answers similar to those in our
version. Then said the Prince to the man, &ldquo;Thy camel is lost; go
and look for it.&rdquo; So the stranger mounted his horse and departed.

<p class="first"><i>The Hunter and his Faithful Dog.</i>&mdash;A
variety of this story is cited from a Cawnpore newspaper, in the
&ldquo;Asiatic Journal,&rdquo; Vol. <span class="sc">XV</span>. (new
series), Part II. October, 1834, p. 78, which is to the following
effect:&mdash;A Bunjarrah named Dabee had a dog called Bhyro, the
faithful companion of his travels, who guarded his goods from robbers
while he slept. He wished to go to a distant part of the country to
trade in grain, but had not sufficient funds for the purpose. After
much cogitation, he at length resolved to pledge his dog for 1,000
rupees, and when he applied to several persons was laughed at for his
folly; but a wealthy merchant named Dyaram gave the money, on condition
that it should be paid back within twelve months, taking the dog Bhyro
in pledge. When eleven months had passed, the merchant began to bewail
the stupidity which had induced him to lend so large a sum on so
precarious a security. His relentings were, however, premature. One
dark and dreary night he was aroused from his slumbers by a great
noise, occasioned by the clashing of swords and the barking of Bhyro. A
band of armed men had entered the house with intent to plunder, but
before they could effect their purpose they had been observed by the
faithful Bhyro, who commenced an attack upon them. Before Dyaram could
render any assistance, Bhyro had laid two of the robbers dead at his
feet; a third, on the approach of Dyaram, aimed a blow at his head,
which was prevented from taking effect by Bhyro seizing the ruffian by
the throat and laying him prostrate on the ground. After peace was
restored, Dyaram congratulated himself on having received Bhyro in
pledge for the Bunjarrah, by which act he not only escaped being
plundered, but in all probably murdered. Next morning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>Dyaram called Bhyro, and after caressing him,
said:&mdash;&ldquo;The service you rendered me last night is more than
an equivalent for the 1,000 rupees I lent your master; go, faithful
creature. I give you a free discharge from your obligation as security
for him.&rdquo; Bhyro shook his head in token that it was impossible
for him to go until his master returned; but Dyaram, comprehending his
meaning, soon arranged matters by writing a statement of the
circumstances, and giving a voucher for the 1,000 rupees. This document
he tied round Bhyro&rsquo;s neck, which done, Bhyro expressed his
delight by leaping about in every direction, and, after licking the
hands of Dyaram, darted out of the house and set off in quest of his
master. While these scenes were transpiring in Dyaram&rsquo;s house,
Dabee was not unmindful of the pledge he had left behind him, and,
having succeeded in his speculation, was returning with all haste to
redeem it. At his last stage homewards he was surprised to see Bhyro
approaching him with every demonstration of joy, but at sight of him
Dabee&rsquo;s rage was kindled, and repulsing Bhyro as he fawned upon
him he thus addressed him:&mdash;&ldquo;O, ungrateful wretch! is this
the return you have made for my kindness to you? and is this the manner
in which you have established my character for veracity? You remained
faithful to your trust during eleven months&mdash;could you not have
held out for thirty short days? You have, by your desertion from your
post, entailed dishonour upon me, and for this you shall die.&rdquo;
And, so saying, he drew his sword and slew him. After having committed
this deed, he observed a paper tied round Bhyro&rsquo;s neck; having
read it, his grief was indescribable. To atone in some measure for his
rash act, caused poor Bhyro to be buried on the spot where he fell, and
a superb monument to be erected over his remains. To the grave of
Bhyro, even at the present day, resort natives who have been bitten by
dogs, they believing that the dust collected there, when applied to the
wounds, is an antidote for hydrophobia. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Notes to XIII.&mdash;The Third Part.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>The Brahman&rsquo;s Wife and the
Mongoose.</i>&mdash;We have, in this story, an Indian variety of the
well-known Welsh legend of Llewellyn and his dog Gellert. A
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5010" title=
"Source: similiar">similar</span> legend was current in France during
the Middle Ages. But our story&mdash;<i>mutatis mutandis</i>&mdash;is
as old as the third century B.C., since it is found in a Buddhist work
of that period. It also occurs in two Sanskrit forms of the celebrated
Fables of Pilpay, or Bidnaia namely the &ldquo;Pancha Tantra&rdquo;
(five chapters), which is said to date as far back as the 5th century
A.D., and the &ldquo;Hitopadesa&rdquo; (Friendly Counsels); also in the
Arabian and other Eastern versions of the same work. It is found in all
the texts of the Book of Sindibad&mdash;Greek, Syriac, Persian, Hebrew,
Old Castilian, Arabic, &amp;c., and in the several European versions,
known generally under the title of &ldquo;The History of the Seven Wise
Masters,&rdquo; the earliest form of which being a Latin prose work
entitled &ldquo;Dolopathos.&rdquo; There are, of course, differences in
the details of the numerous versions both Western and Eastern, but the
fundamental outline is the same in all. In my work on the migrations of
popular tales, I have reproduced all the known versions of this
world-wide story, with the exception of that in the present romance,
which is singular in representing the woman as killing herself after
she had discovered her fatal mistake, and her husband as slaying his
little son and himself. The author of the romance probably added these
tragedies, in order to enable the supposed narrator to more forcibly
impress the king with the <span class="corr" id="xd26e5016" title=
"Source: grevious">grievous</span> consequences of acting in affairs of
moment with inconsiderateness and precipitation. In most versions it is
the husband who kills the faithful animal. Among the Malays the story
of the Snake and the Mongoose is current in this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>form:&mdash;A man left a tame bear in charge of
his house, and of his sleeping child, while he was absent from home. On
his return he missed his child, the house was in disorder, as if some
great struggle had taken place, and the floor was covered with blood.
Hastily concluding that the bear had killed and devoured the child, the
enraged father slew the animal with his spear, but almost immediately
afterwards found the carcase of a tiger, which the faithful bear had
defeated and killed, and the child emerged unharmed from the jungle,
where it had taken refuge.</p>
<p>In a black-letter English edition of the &ldquo;Seven Wise
Masters,&rdquo; the knight, having slain his hound and discovered his
child safe in its cradle, exclaims (and here the hand of the misogynist
monkish writer is very evident!)&mdash;&ldquo;Woe be to me, that, for
the words of my wife, I have slain my good and best greyhound, the
which had saved my child&rsquo;s life, and hath slain the serpent;
therefore I will put myself to penance.&rdquo; And so he brake his
sword in three pieces, and travelled in the direction of the Holy Land,
and abode there all the days of his life. The preceding story of the
Hunter and his Dog, it will be observed, is closely allied to that of
the Brahman&rsquo;s Wife and the Mongoose; and in conclusion, where the
hunter erects a stately tomb over his dog&rsquo;s remains, it presents
a striking resemblance to the Welsh legend of Llewellyn and the dog
Gellert, which is probably not merely fortuitous.</p>
<p>A very curious version is found in a black-letter chapter-book,
entitled the &ldquo;Seven Wise Mistresses,&rdquo; written in imitation
of the &ldquo;Seven Wise Masters,&rdquo; by one Thomas Howard, about
the end of the seventeenth century, in which a knight and his lady are
wrecked and cast ashore on a desert island, and the knight soon
afterwards dies. His wife takes a thorn out of a lion&rsquo;s foot
(Androcles in petticoats), and the grateful animal follows her about,
and provides her with food, and this is how the story goes
on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last she began mourning to herself, deploring her
condition in living in such obscurity in a foreign Country, and as her
daily companion, a savage Beast, her mind yearning after her own
habitation, she thus complained: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296"
href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>&rsquo;Oh, how hath fortune
frowned on me that I am driven out from all human knowledge, and am
glad to take up my habitation with the Beast of the Field!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As she thus complained to herself, the Devil chanced to
appear to her, and demanded the cause of her complaint, and she related
all to him as you have heard. Then said he to her: &lsquo;What wilt
thou give and I will provide a ship which shall carry thee home to thy
own country.&rsquo; She answered: &lsquo;Half my Estates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd26e5033" title=
"Not in source">&lsquo;</span>Nay,&rsquo; said the Devil, &lsquo;If
thou wilt give me thy Soul at the term of twelve years, I will set thee
down in thy own country, and thou shalt live and flourish so
long.&rsquo; &lsquo;God forbid,&rsquo; said the Lady. &lsquo;I would
rather end my wretched life in this solitary island than
that.<span class="corr" id="xd26e5036" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> &lsquo;Why then,&rsquo; said the Devil,
&lsquo;I will make this bargain with you, that if you abstain from
sleeping all the time of our voyage, which shall be but three days, I
will have nothing to do with your Soul; if you sleep, I will have it as
I have said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And upon this bargain the lady ventured, provided she might
have her Lion with her. So &rsquo;twas concluded, and a brave Ship came
and took the Lady and her Lion. When she lay down the Lion lay by her,
and if she slumbered the Lion would touch her with his paw, by which
means he kept her awake all the voyage, until she landed in her own
country, and being come to her Father&rsquo;s house, she knocked at the
gate. Then the Porter coming with all speed opened the gate and thought
that it was a Beggar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frowningly he shut it again, saying, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing here for you.&rsquo; Then she bounced at the gate again, and
asked the Porter if such a Knight lived there, meaning her Father, and
he said &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then<span class="corr" id="xd26e5043"
title="Not in source">,</span>&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;Pray, deliver
this piece of ring unto him.&rsquo; Now this ring was it she brake
betwixt her Father and she at her departure out of the land. Then the
Porter delivered the Ring to his Master, saying<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5046" title="Source: ;">:</span> &lsquo;The Beggar woman at the
gate willed me to deliver the piece of ring unto you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Knight saw the ring he fell down in a swound but
when he was revived he said, &lsquo;Call her in, for she is my
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>only Daughter, whom I thought was dead.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the Porter, &lsquo;I dare not call her in, for
there is a mighty Lion with her.&rsquo; &lsquo;Though it be,&rsquo;
said the Knight, &lsquo;call her in.&rsquo; Then said the Porter [to
the Lady], &lsquo;You are to come in, but leave your Lion
outside.<span class="corr" id="xd26e5053" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the Lady,
&lsquo;my Lion goes whereever I go, and where he is not, there will I
not be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when she came to her Father she fell down on her knees
and wept. Her Father took her up in his arms and kissed her, weeping as
fast, and after he clothed her in purple, and placed her by him in a
chair, and demanded an account of her travels, and she told him all
that had happened, and how the Lion had saved her life, and was the
greatest comfort she had in the Wilderness. It chanced afterwards that
as the Knight was going into his Wood to look after his young Horses,
he met with a wild Boar, with whom he fell in combat. The Lion loved
the Old Knight, and by accident walking along he scented the Boar, and
as the Lion ran toward the place where the Boar was, the Steward espied
him, and he ran into the Palace, and cryed out, <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5058" title="Source: the &lsquo;">&lsquo;the</span> Lion is
running after my Master to destroy him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Lady sent after him ten of her servants, who met the
Lion, his mouth all bloody, and they ran back and told the Lady the
Lion had destroyed her aged Father. Then said the Lady, &lsquo;O woe is
me that ever I was born, that have brought a Lion from far to destroy
my own Father.&rsquo; Therefore she commanded her servants to slay the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5064" title="Source: Lyon">Lion</span>,
which no sooner was done but her Father came in, and said; &lsquo;O, I
have met with a wild Boar, with whom I fought, and there came the Lion
to my aid, and slew the Boar, and so saved my life, else I had died by
the Boar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Lady heard this, O how she wept and wrung her hands,
saying, &lsquo;For the words of a wicked Steward, I have slain my good
Lion, who hath saved my life and my Father&rsquo;s. Cursed be the time
I was advised by him.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p><i>The Faithless Wife and the Ungrateful Blind Man.</i>&mdash;I do
not remember having met with this story in any other collection,
although there are there many tales in Asiatic story-books of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>women abandoning their blind or infirm husbands,
and going off with strange men. A very considerable proportion, in fact
of Eastern stories turn upon the alleged wickedness and profligacy and
intrigues of women. This most unjust estimate of &ldquo;the sex&rdquo;
seems to have been universal in Asiatic countries from every remote
times and probably was introduced into Europe through the Crusades. Not
a few of the medi&aelig;val Monkish tales represent women in a very
unfavourable light, and this is also the case in our early English
jest-books, which were compiled soon after the invention of printing.
In the oldest Indian literature, however, especially the two grand
epics &ldquo;Ramayana&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mahabharata,&rdquo; occur
several notable tales of noble women, such as &ldquo;Dushyanta and
Sakuntala,&rdquo; and the charming romance of &ldquo;Nala and
Damayanti;&rdquo; and in another work, the &ldquo;Adventures of the Ten
princes,&rdquo; (&ldquo;Dasa Kumara Charita,&rdquo;) the fine story of
Gomiui, who is held up as a pattern to her sex. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>The Wonderful Mango-fruit.</i>&mdash;A variety of
this story occurs in the Persian &ldquo;Tuti Nama&rdquo; of
Nakhshabi:&mdash;A Prince, who is very ill, sends a parrot of great
sagacity to procure him some fruit of the Tree of Life. When at length
the bird returns with the life-giving fruit, the Prince scruples to eat
of it, upon which the parrot relates the legend of &ldquo;Solomon and
the Water of Immortality;&rdquo; how that wise monarch declined to
procure immunity from death, on consideration that he should thus
survive all his friends and female favourites. The Prince, however,
being suspicious regarding the fruit, sent some trusty messengers to
&ldquo;bring the first apple that fell from the Tree of
Existence.&rdquo; But it happened that a black snake had poisoned it by
seizing it in its mouth and then letting it drop again. When the
messengers returned with the fruit, the Prince tried the effect on a
holy man, who instantly falls down dead. Upon seeing this, the Prince
dooms the parrot to death; but the sagacious bird suggests that, before
the Prince should execute him for treason, he should himself go to the
Tree of Life and make another experiment with its fruit. The Prince
does so, and, returning home, gives part of the fruit to an old woman,
&ldquo;who, from age and infirmity, had not stirred abroad for many
years;&rdquo; and, no sooner had she tasted it, than she was changed
into a charming girl of eighteen. But more closely resembling our story
is a version in a Canarese collection, entitled &ldquo;Katha
Manjari&rdquo;:&mdash;A certain king had a magpie that flew one day to
heaven with another magpie. From thence it took away some mango seed,
and, having returned, gave it to the king, saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you cause this to be planted and grow, whoever eats of its
fruit old age will forsake him and his youth be restored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king was much pleased, and caused it to be planted in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>his favourite garden. After some years, buds
appeared and became flowers, then young fruit, then full grown; and
when the fruit was ripe the king ordered one to be plucked and brought
to him, when he gave it to an old man. But on it had fallen poison from
a serpent as it was carried through the air by a kite, so the old man
immediately withered and died. The king, on seeing this, exclaimed in
wrath:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not this bird attempting to kill me?&rdquo; And he seized
the magpie and wrung off its head. Afterwards in the village the tree
had the name of the poisonous mango. Now, it happened that a washerman,
taking the part of his wife in a quarrel with his old mother, struck
the latter, who was so angry at her son that she resolved to die, in
order that the blame of her death should fall upon him; and having gone
to the poisonous mango-tree in the garden, she cut off a fruit and ate
it, when instantly she became more blooming than a girl of sixteen.
This miracle she published everywhere and it came to the king&rsquo;s
ears, who, having called her and seen her, caused the fruit to be given
to other old people. Having seen what was thus done by the marvelous
virtue of the mango-fruit, the king sorrowfully exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, the faithful magpie is killed which gave me this divine
tree! How guilty am I!&rdquo; And he pierced himself with his sword and
died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; adds the story-teller, &ldquo;those who act
without thought are certain to be ruined.&rdquo; The old
Brahman&rsquo;s generously presenting the king with the wonderful
mango-fruit in our story, finds its parallel with a difference, in the
Hindu romance entitled &ldquo;Simhasana Dwatrinsatri,&rdquo; or
Thirty-two Tales of a throne, where a Brahman having received from the
gods, as a reward for his devotional austerities, the fruit of
immortality, joyfully proceeds home and shows it to his wife, who
advises him to give it to the Raja <span class="corr" id="xd26e5097"
title="Source: Bhartrigari">Bhartrihari</span>, as the wealth he should
receive in return were preferable to an endless life of poverty. He
goes to the palace, and presenting the fruit to the Raja, acquaints him
of its nature, and is rewarded with a lakh of rupees. The Raja gives
the fruit to his wife, telling her that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>if she ate it her
beauty would increase day by day, and she should be immortal. The Kani
gives it to her paramour, the chief of police, who, in his turn,
presents it as the choicest of gifts to a courtesan, who, after
reflecting that it would only enable her to commit innumerable sins,
resolves to offer it to the Raja, in hope of a reward in a future life.
When Raja Bhartrihari receives the fruit again he is astonished, and,
on learning from the <i>h&aelig;tera</i> from whom she had obtained it,
he knew that his queen was unfaithful, and, abandoning his throne and
kingdom, departs into the jungle, where he became an ascetic.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>The Poisoned Food.</i>&mdash;This is a third
instance of food or fruit being poisoned by serpents, and it occurs
very frequently in Eastern stories. The oldest form of this tale is
found in a Sanskrit collection entitled &ldquo;Twenty-five Tales of a
Vampyre&rdquo; (<i>Vetalapanchavimsati</i>), which is probably of
Buddhist extraction, and which also exists in many of the vernacular
languages of India. The wife of a man named Harisvamin having been
stolen from him one night by a Vidyadhara Prince, he gave away all his
wealth to the Brahmans, and resolved to visit the sacred waters to wash
away his sins, after which he hoped to recover his beloved wife; and
the story thus proceeds:&mdash;Then he left the country, with his
Brahman birth as his only fortune, and began to go round to all the
sacred bathing-places in order to recover his beloved. And as he was
roaming about there came upon him the terrible lion of the hot season,
with the blazing sun for mouth and with a mane composed of his fiery
rays. And the winds blew with excessive heat, as if warmed by the
breath of sighs furnaced forth by travellers grieved at being separated
from their wives. And the tanks, with their supply of water diminished
by the heat and their drying white mud, appeared to be showing their
broken hearts. And the trees by the roadside seemed to lament on
account of the departure of the glory of spring, making their wailing
heard in the shrill moaning of their bark, with leaves, as it were,
lips, parched with heat.</p>
<p>At that season Harisvamin, wearied out with the heat of the sun,
with bereavement, hunger and thirst, and continual travelling,
emaciated and dirty, and pining for food, reached in the course of his
wanderings a certain village, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303"
href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>found in it the house of a
Brahman named Padmanabha, who was engaged in a sacrifice. And, seeing
that many Brahmans were eating in his house, he stood leaning against
the door-post, silent and motionless. And the good wife of that Brahman
named Padmanabha, seeing him in this position, felt pity for him, and
reflected:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! mighty is hunger! Whom will it not bring down? For here
stands a man at the door, who appears to be a householder, desiring
food, with downcast countenance; evidently come from a long journey,
and with all his faculties impaired by hunger. So is not he a man to
whom food ought to be given?&rdquo; Having gone through these
reflections, that kind woman took up in her hand a vessel full of rice
boiled in milk, with <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e5123" title=
"Source: ghi">gh&icirc;</span></i> and sugar, and brought it, and
courteously presented it to him, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and eat this somewhere on the bank of the lake, for this
place is unfit to eat in, as it is filled with feasting
Brahmans.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; and took the
vessel of rice and placed it at no great distance under a banyan-tree
on the edge of the lake; and he washed his hands and feet in the lake,
and rinsed his mouth, and then came back in high spirits to eat the
rice. But while he was thus engaged a kite, holding a black cobra with
its beak and claws, came and sat on that tree. And it so happened that
poisonous saliva issued from the mouth of that dead snake, which the
bird had captured and was carrying along. The saliva fell into the dish
of rice which was placed under the tree, and Harisvamin, without
observing it, came and ate up that rice. As soon as in his hunger he
had devoured all that food, he began to suffer terrible agonies, caused
by the poison. He exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When fate has turned against a man, everything in this world
turns also; accordingly this rice has become poison to me.&rdquo; Thus
speaking, Harisvamin, tortured with the poison, tottered to the house
of that Brahman who was engaged in a sacrifice, and said to his
wife:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rice which you gave me has poisoned me; so fetch me
quickly a charmer who can counteract the operation of poison; otherwise
you will be guilty of the death of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb304" href="#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span>Brahman.&rdquo; When
Harisvamin had said this to the good woman, who was beside herself to
think what it could all mean, his eyes closed and he died.</p>
<p>Then the Brahman who was engaged in a sacrifice drove his wife out
of the house, though she was innocent and hospitable, being enraged
with her for the supposed murder of her guest. The good woman, for her
part, having incurred groundless blame from her charitable deed, and so
become burdened with infamy, went to a holy bathing-place, to perform
penance. Then there was a discussion before the superintendent of
religion as to which of the four parties, the kite, the snake, and the
couple who gave rice, was guilty of the murder of a Brahman; but the
question was not decided.</p>
<p>It will be seen that our story differs very considerably from the
foregoing, which we must regard as the original. The same story occurs
in all the Eastern versions of the Book of Sindibad, but in most of
these it is not a traveller who is thus poisoned, but a wealthy man and
his guests; having sent a domestic to the market to buy sour curds,
which she carried back in an open vessel, poison from a serpent in a
stork&rsquo;s mouth dropped into the curds, of which the master of the
house and his guests partook and died. The story is probably more than
2,000 years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eating up the Protector.</i>&rdquo; Akin to this, but with
a very different conclusion, is the well-known story of the traveller
who released a tiger from a trap into which he had fallen. The
Brahman&rsquo;s fidelity to his pact with the serpent reminds one of
the Arabian story of the Merchant and the Genie. In a Tamil tale, a cow
having given herself up to a tiger to redeem her owner (it is to be
understood, of course, that both animals are human beings re-born in
those forms) she obtains leave to go and suckle her calf, after which
she returns when the tiger, moved by her fidelity, lets her go
free.</p>
<p>The serpent&rsquo;s emitting gems recalls Shakespeare&rsquo;s
allusion to the popular notion of the &ldquo;toad, ugly and venomous,
which bears a precious jewel in its head.&rdquo; It is a very ancient
and widespread belief that serpents are the guardians of hidden
treasures. Preller, in his work on Grecian mythology, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>refers to a Servian story in which a shepherd,
as in our tale, saves the life of a snake in a forest fire, and, in
return for this service, the snake&rsquo;s father gives him endless
treasures and teaches him the language of birds. There is a very
similar story in Dozon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Contes Albanais.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the charming tale of &ldquo;Nala and Damayanti,&rdquo; which
occurs in the third part (&ldquo;Vana Parva&rdquo;) of the grand Indian
epic &ldquo;Mahabharata,&rdquo; the exiled king perceives a snake with
a ray of jewels in its crest, writhing in a jungle fire, and lifting it
out, carries it some distance, and is about to set it down, when the
snake says to him, &ldquo;Carry me ten steps farther, and count them
aloud as you go.&rdquo; So Nala proceeds, counting the steps&mdash;one,
two, three&mdash;and when he said &ldquo;ten&rdquo; (<i>dasa</i>, which
means &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and also &ldquo;bite&rdquo;) the snake took him
at his word, and bit the king in the forehead, upon which he became
black and deformed.</p>
<p>An abstract of a considerably modified form of our romance orally
current among the people of Bengal may be given in conclusion: A king
appoints his three sons to patrol in turn the streets of his capital
during the night. It happens that the youngest Prince in going his
rounds one night sees a beautiful woman issuing from the royal palace,
and accosting her, asks her business at such an hour. She
replies:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the guardian deity of this palace; the king will be
killed this night, therefore I am going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince persuades the goddess to return into the palace and await
the event. As in our story, he enters his father&rsquo;s sleeping
chamber and discovers a huge cobra near the royal couch. He cuts the
serpent into many pieces, which he puts inside a brass vessel that is
in the room. Then seeing that some drops of the serpent&rsquo;s blood
had fallen on his step-mother&rsquo;s breast, he wraps a piece of cloth
round his tongue to protect it from the poison, and licks off the
blood. The lady awakes, and recognises him as he is leaving the room.
She accuses him to the king of having used an unpardonable freedom with
her. In the morning the king sends for his eldest son, and asks him:
&ldquo;If a trusted servant should prove faithless how should he be
punished?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306"
name="pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>Quoth the Prince: &ldquo;Surely his head should be parted from his
body; but before doing so you should ascertain whether the man is
actually guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he proceeds to relate the following
story:&mdash;&ldquo;Once upon a time there was a goldsmith who had a
grown-up son, whose wife was acquainted with the language of animals,
but she kept secret from her husband and all others the fact of her
being endowed with such a rare gift. It happened one night she heard a
jackal exclaim: &lsquo;There is a dead body floating on the river;
would that some one might give me that body to eat, and for his pains
take the diamond ring from the finger of the dead man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman arose from her bed and went to the bank of the
river, and her husband, who was not asleep, followed her unobserved.
She went into the water, drew the corpse to land, and unable to loosen
the ring from the dead man&rsquo;s finger, which had swelled, she bit
off the finger, and leaving the corpse on the bank, returned home,
whither she had been preceded by her husband. Almost petrified with
fear, the young goldsmith concluded from what he had seen that his wife
was not a human being, but a ghoul (<i>rakshasi</i>), and early in the
morning he hastened to his father and related the whole affair to
him&mdash;how the woman had got up during the night and gone to the
river, out of which she dragged a dead body to the land, and was busy
devouring it when he ran home in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man was greatly shocked, and advised his son to take
his wife on some pretext into the forest and leave her there to be
destroyed by wild beasts. So the husband caused the woman to get
herself ready to go on a visit to her father, and after a hasty
breakfast they set out. In going through a dense jungle, where the
goldsmith proposed abandoning his wife, she heard a serpent cry,
&lsquo;O, passenger, I pray thee to seize and give me that croaking
frog, and take for thy reward the gold and precious stones concealed in
yonder hole.&rsquo; The woman at once seized the frog and threw it
towards the serpent, and then began digging into the ground with a
stick. Her husband quaked with fear, thinking that his ghoul-wife
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>was about to kill him, but she called to him,
saying, &lsquo;My dear husband, gather up all this gold and precious
gems.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Approaching the spot with hesitation he was surprised to
perceive an immense treasure laid bare by his wife, who then explained
to him how she had learned of it from the snake that lay coiled up near
them, whose language she understood. Then he said to his
wife&mdash;&lsquo;It is now so late that we cannot reach your
father&rsquo;s house before dark, and we might be slain by wild beasts.
Let us therefore return home.&rsquo; So they retraced their steps, and
approaching the house the goldsmith said to his wife&mdash;&lsquo;Do,
you, my dear, go in by the back door, while I enter by the front and
show my father all this treasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e5176" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>The woman went in by the back door and
was met by her father-in-law, who, on seeing her, concluded that she
had killed and devoured his son, and striking her on the head with a
hammer which he happened to have in his hand, she instantly expired.
Just then the son came into the room, but it was too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told your Majesty this story,&rdquo; adds the eldest
Prince, &ldquo;in order that before putting the man to death you should
make sure that he is guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king next calls his second son and asks him the same question,
to which he replies by relating a story to caution his father against
rash actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A king, separated from his attendants while engaged in the
chase, saw what he conceived to be rain-water dropping from the top of
a tree, and, being very thirst, held his drinking cup under it until it
was nearly filled, and, just as he was about to put it to his lips, his
horse purposely moved so as to cause the contents to be spilled on the
ground, upon which the king in a rage drew his sword and killed the
faithful animal; but afterwards discovering that what he had taken for
rain-water was poison that dropped from a cobra in the tree, his grief
knew no bounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calling lastly his third son, the king asks him what should be done
to the man who proved false to his trust. The Prince tells the story of
the wonderful tree, the fruit of which <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>bestowed on him who
ate of it perennial youth, with unimportant variations from the version
in our romance.</p>
<p>Then the Prince explained the occasion of his presence in the Royal
bedchamber, and how he had saved the king and his consort from the
cobra&rsquo;s deadly bite. And the king, overjoyed and full of
gratitude, strained his faithful son to his heart, and ever after
cherished and loved him with all a father&rsquo;s love.</p>
